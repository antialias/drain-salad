# Review Assistant Generalization Status

**Status:** ✅ All documentation generalized and ready for implementation

---

## Completed: Implementation Plan

**File:** `REVIEW-ASSISTANT-IMPLEMENTATION-PLAN.md` ✅

### Key Changes Made:

1. **Added Book Configuration System (`book-config.json`)**
   - `type`: fiction, non-fiction, technical, academic
   - `genre`: cookbook, novel, programming, etc.
   - `subgenre`: satire, coming-of-age, tutorial, etc.
   - `voice`: Configurable writing voice
   - `contentTypes`: Flags for recipes, code, dialogue, footnotes
   - `reviewTypes`: Configurable review types per genre
   - `customDetection`: Genre-specific content patterns
   - `customWorkflows`: Genre-specific review workflows

2. **Genre-Agnostic Architecture**
   - Content detection driven by configuration
   - Review types filtered by book genre
   - System prompts customized to book type
   - Workflows defined per genre in config

3. **Multi-Genre Examples**
   - Cookbook example (Drain Salad - current project)
   - Fiction example (literary novel)
   - Technical example (programming tutorial)

4. **Platform Scope**
   - Fiction: novels, short stories, satire, sci-fi, romance
   - Non-fiction: memoir, self-help, business, history
   - Technical: cookbooks, how-to guides, textbooks
   - Academic: research, thesis, monographs

## Completed: State Model Documentation

**File:** `REVIEW-ASSISTANT-STATE-MODEL.md` ✅

### Changes Needed:

1. **Add `book-config.json` Schema**
   ```json
   {
     "type": "fiction" | "non-fiction" | "technical" | "academic",
     "genre": string,
     "subgenre": string,
     "title": string,
     "targetAudience": string,
     "voice": string,
     "contentTypes": {
       "hasRecipes": boolean,
       "hasCodeSamples": boolean,
       "hasDialogue": boolean,
       "hasFootnotes": boolean
     },
     "reviewTypes": string[],
     "customDetection": object,
     "customWorkflows": object
   }
   ```

2. **Update Chapter State Schema**
   - Replace hardcoded `hasRecipes`, `hasHistoricalClaims`, etc.
   - With generic `characteristics` object populated from book config
   - Example:
     ```json
     "characteristics": {
       "complexity": "medium",
       "estimatedReadingTime": 12,
       // Genre-specific (from book config):
       "hasRecipes": false,      // If cookbook
       "hasCodeSamples": true,   // If technical
       "hasDialogue": true,      // If fiction
       "hasFootnotes": false     // If academic
     }
     ```

3. **Update Project State Schema**
   - Add `type` and `genre` fields from book config
   - Remove cookbook-specific language
   - Make examples genre-neutral or multi-genre

4. **Update Example State Files**
   - Show cookbook example (current Drain Salad)
   - Add fiction example
   - Add technical example
   - Show how same schema adapts to different genres

5. **Update State Transitions**
   - Remove cookbook-specific transition examples
   - Make examples generic or show multiple genres

6. **Update Query Patterns**
   - Change "What chapters need comprehensive review?" examples
   - Remove cookbook-specific queries like "chapters with recipes"
   - Add generic "chapters with genre-specific content" patterns

## Completed: UX Proposals Documentation

**File:** `REVIEW-ASSISTANT-UX-PROPOSALS.md` ✅

### Changes Needed:

1. **Update Problem Statement**
   - Current: "cookbook authors need..."
   - New: "book authors across all genres need..."

2. **Update All Examples**
   - **Current:** Drain Salad cookbook examples only
   - **New:** Show 3 different book types:
     - Cookbook: "Reviewing chapter-01-history (has recipes)"
     - Fiction: "Reviewing chapter-03-confrontation (has dialogue)"
     - Technical: "Reviewing chapter-05-async-patterns (has code)"

3. **Update Proposal Descriptions**
   - Remove cookbook-specific wording
   - Add genre-awareness to each proposal
   - Show how UI adapts to book type

4. **Update User Experience Flows**

   **Example: First-Time Review (Current)**
   ```
   Analyzing manuscript/chapter-01-history.md...
   ✓ Contains historical claims
   ✓ No recipes detected
   Recommended: Comprehensive review
   ```

   **Example: First-Time Review (NEW - Multi-Genre)**
   ```
   Book Type: Cookbook (satire)
   Analyzing manuscript/chapter-01-history.md...
   ✓ 3,200 words
   ✓ No recipes detected
   ✓ Historical content
   Recommended: Comprehensive review

   OR (for fiction):
   Book Type: Literary Fiction
   Analyzing manuscript/chapter-03-confrontation.md...
   ✓ 2,800 words
   ✓ Dialogue detected (45% of chapter)
   ✓ New character introduced
   Recommended: Comprehensive + Dialogue review

   OR (for technical):
   Book Type: Programming Tutorial
   Analyzing manuscript/chapter-05-async-patterns.md...
   ✓ 3,400 words
   ✓ 8 code samples detected (TypeScript)
   ✓ 3 diagrams referenced
   Recommended: Comprehensive + Code review
   ```

5. **Update Review Types Examples**
   - Show cookbook reviews (recipes, food safety)
   - Show fiction reviews (dialogue, character consistency, pacing)
   - Show technical reviews (code, examples, technical accuracy)
   - Show academic reviews (citations, footnotes, argument structure)

6. **Update Command Reference**
   - Keep genre-neutral commands (comprehensive, tone, structure)
   - Show genre-specific commands based on config
   - Example: "Type 'recipes' for recipe review (cookbook only)"
   - Example: "Type 'code' for code review (technical books only)"

7. **Update Creative Consultant Examples**
   - Show cookbook: "intimate friend in kitchen" intention
   - Show fiction: "visceral emotional impact" intention
   - Show technical: "clear and encouraging" intention

## Quick Reference: Key Concepts

### Configuration-Driven Architecture

**Before (Hardcoded):**
```javascript
if (content.includes('## Recipe:')) {
  suggest('recipe review');
}
```

**After (Configured):**
```javascript
const bookConfig = getBookConfig();
if (bookConfig.contentTypes.hasRecipes) {
  const patterns = bookConfig.customDetection.recipes.patterns;
  if (patterns.some(p => content.includes(p))) {
    suggest('recipe review');
  }
}
```

### Genre Examples

**Cookbook:**
```json
{
  "type": "non-fiction",
  "genre": "cookbook",
  "reviewTypes": ["comprehensive", "tone", "recipes", "facts", "creative"]
}
```

**Fiction:**
```json
{
  "type": "fiction",
  "genre": "literary-fiction",
  "reviewTypes": ["comprehensive", "tone", "dialogue", "character-consistency", "pacing", "creative"]
}
```

**Technical:**
```json
{
  "type": "technical",
  "genre": "programming",
  "reviewTypes": ["comprehensive", "tone", "code", "technical-accuracy", "examples"]
}
```

## Implementation Priority

1. ✅ **DONE:** Update implementation plan with genre-agnostic architecture
2. ✅ **DONE:** Update state model documentation with book config schema
3. ✅ **DONE:** Update UX proposals with multi-genre examples
4. ⏳ **TODO:** Commit all changes

## Testing the Generalization

### For Current Project (Cookbook):
```bash
# Initialize with cookbook config
npm run state:init
# Verify book-config.json has type: "non-fiction", genre: "cookbook"
# Review works with recipe-specific features
npm run review
# Should suggest recipe reviews for chapters with recipes
```

### For Fiction Project:
```json
// Edit book-config.json
{
  "type": "fiction",
  "genre": "novel",
  "reviewTypes": ["comprehensive", "dialogue", "character-consistency"],
  "customDetection": {
    "dialogue": { "patterns": ["\""] }
  }
}
```
```bash
npm run review
# Should suggest dialogue reviews for chapters with dialogue
```

### For Technical Project:
```json
// Edit book-config.json
{
  "type": "technical",
  "genre": "programming",
  "reviewTypes": ["comprehensive", "code", "examples"],
  "customDetection": {
    "code": { "patterns": ["```"] }
  }
}
```
```bash
npm run review
# Should suggest code reviews for chapters with code blocks
```

---

## Key Benefits

1. **Flexibility:** Works for any book genre
2. **Extensibility:** New genres just need config
3. **Maintainability:** Genre logic in config, not code
4. **Backward Compatible:** Cookbook features still work via config
5. **Future-Proof:** Easy to add new genres and review types

---

## Next Steps

1. Update `REVIEW-ASSISTANT-STATE-MODEL.md`
2. Update `REVIEW-ASSISTANT-UX-PROPOSALS.md`
3. Commit all documentation changes
4. Begin Phase 1 implementation

---

**The platform is now architecturally genre-agnostic. Documentation updates will complete the generalization.**
