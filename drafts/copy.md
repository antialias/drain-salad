Here’s a full suite of **professionally styled copy** for the *Drain Salad* cookbook—written in the tone of a cult-favorite, design-driven culinary artifact that takes itself (and its humor) deliciously seriously.

# 🥗 **Drain Salad**

### *A Treatise on Edible Entropy, Upstream Capture, and the Cuisine of Second Harvest*

---

## 📖 **Back-Cover Copy**

> *Every kitchen hides an ecosystem of quiet abundance. Beneath the cutting board, at the lip of the sink, the overlooked becomes the essential.*
>
> *Drain Salad* is a manifesto for modern thrift and mindful appetite—a love letter to the scraps, stems, and crumbs that never quite make it to the plate. With the tone of a philosophy text and the elegance of a Michelin tasting menu, this book reframes waste as ingredient, residue as revelation, and “leftover” as a verb.
>
> Inside you’ll find:
> • The history of “drain cuisine”—from medieval stockpots to zero-waste kitchens.
> • Techniques for the **Clean-Catch Method**: the safe, elegant art of upstream scrap capture.
> • 40+ recipes that transform yesterday’s flavor ghosts into today’s centerpiece dishes.
> • Essays on entropy, aesthetics, and edible archaeology.
> • A taxonomy of *Drain Salad* species—Sludge Caesar, Compost Cobb, Garbage Garden, Sewer Slaw.
>
> *Drain Salad* invites you to taste the hidden narrative of your kitchen. It’s serious about flavor, unserious about perfection, and unapologetically curious about everything that swirls down the drain.

## 🍽️ **Inside-Flap Copy (Author’s Voice)**

> In every household, the drain is both grave and genesis. What slips away there is not garbage—it’s potential.
>
> This book is my attempt to reimagine the kitchen as a closed-loop ecosystem, where flavor, ethics, and humor mingle freely. Call it *domestic alchemy*, call it *culinary anthropology*, call it *hubris with a vinaigrette*—but whatever you call it, it tastes good.

Would you like me to design **the back-cover layout** next—with typesetting hierarchy, publisher-style credits, and sample blurbs arranged in a print-ready visual mockup (for display or pitch deck use)?
