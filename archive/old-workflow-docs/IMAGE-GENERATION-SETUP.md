# Image Generation Setup Guide

## Overview

This system uses **reference photos** + **descriptive prompts** to generate consistent images, especially for author photos where the same person needs to appear across multiple shots.

### Key Features

‚úÖ **Reference image support** - Use a photo to maintain character consistency
‚úÖ **Automated generation** - npm scripts manage the entire workflow
‚úÖ **Multiple backends** - Replicate API, ComfyUI, or Automatic1111
‚úÖ **Batch processing** - Generate all images with one command
‚úÖ **Progress tracking** - See generation status in real-time

---

## Quick Start (5 Minutes)

### 1. Install Dependencies

```bash
npm install
```

### 2. Set Up Configuration

```bash
# Copy the example config
cp .env.example .env

# Edit .env and add your API key
nano .env
```

Add your Replicate API token (get it from https://replicate.com/account/api-tokens):

```env
REPLICATE_API_TOKEN=r8_your_token_here
IMAGE_GEN_BACKEND=replicate
```

### 3. Generate First Author Photo (This Becomes Your Reference)

```bash
# Generate just the author bio photo (image #2)
npm run generate:images -- --single 2
```

This will:
- Use the detailed prompt from `scripts/image-prompts/002_author-photo.txt`
- Generate Italian-American man character based on detailed description
- Save to `manuscript/images/front-matter/002_author-photo.png`
- **Automatically save as reference** for all future author photos

### 4. Generate Remaining Author Photos (Will Use Reference)

```bash
# Generate all 8 author photos using the reference
npm run generate:author
```

All subsequent author photos will use image #2 as a **face reference**, ensuring the same person appears in every photo.

### 5. Generate Food Photography

```bash
# Generate all food hero shots and process sequences
npm run generate:food
```

### 6. Generate Everything Else

```bash
# Generate all priority images (25 images)
npm run generate:priority

# Or generate ALL images (82 images)
npm run generate:images
```

## How Reference Photos Work

### The Reference Photo Approach

1. **First generation** (image #2 - author bio photo):
   - Generated from detailed text description only
   - Saved as `manuscript/images/reference/author-reference.png`
   - This establishes the character

2. **Subsequent generations** (images with `type: author`):
   - Use the reference photo + new prompt
   - AI maintains facial features from reference
   - Changes only context (setting, expression, action)

### Technical Implementation

**Replicate Backend** uses **InstantID model**:
```javascript
{
  face_image: "base64_encoded_reference_photo",
  prompt: "Same person from reference, now at stove cooking...",
  identitynet_strength_ratio: 0.8,  // 80% face consistency
  adapter_strength_ratio: 0.8       // 80% style adherence
}
```

This ensures:
- Same facial structure across all photos
- Same skin tone, hair, facial features
- Only clothing, background, and pose change

---

## Available npm Scripts

### Generation Commands

```bash
# Generate all images
npm run generate:images

# Generate only Phase 1 priority images (25 images)
npm run generate:priority

## Backend Options

### Option 1: Replicate API (Recommended for Character Consistency)

**Pros:**
- ‚úÖ **Supports face reference** (InstantID model)
- ‚úÖ **Best character consistency** across author photos
- ‚úÖ Cloud-based (no local GPU needed)
- ‚úÖ Reliable, fast
- ‚úÖ Works out of the box

**Cons:**
- üíµ Costs ~$0.05-0.15 per image (~$6-12 for all 82 images)

**Setup:**
1. Sign up at https://replicate.com
2. Get API token from account settings
3. Add to `.env`: `REPLICATE_API_TOKEN=r8_...`
4. Set backend: `IMAGE_GEN_BACKEND=replicate`
5. Run: `npm run generate:priority`

---

### Option 2: OpenAI GPT Image (gpt-image-1) - Best of Both Worlds! üî•

**Pros:**
- ‚úÖ **Reference image support!** - Uses Responses API for character consistency
- ‚úÖ **Superior instruction following** - Better than DALL-E 3 and Replicate
- ‚úÖ **High input fidelity** - Preserves facial features from reference images
- ‚úÖ **Better text rendering** - Improved over DALL-E series
- ‚úÖ **Real-world knowledge** - Understands context and composition
- ‚úÖ Cloud-based (no local GPU needed)
- ‚úÖ Natural, photorealistic style

**Cons:**
- üíµ Token-based pricing (varies by size/quality, ~$0.10-0.20 per image)
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Max size 1536px (vs 3072px target, but acceptable quality)
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Model may revise prompts for safety/quality

**Setup:**
1. Get OpenAI API key from https://platform.openai.com/api-keys
2. Add to `.env`: `OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-...`
3. Set backend: `IMAGE_GEN_BACKEND=dalle`
4. Run: `npm run generate:priority`

**How Reference Images Work:**
The backend uses OpenAI's **Responses API** with the `image_generation` tool:
```javascript
{
  input: [
    { type: 'input_text', text: 'Italian-American man cooking...' },
    { type: 'input_image', image_url: 'data:image/png;base64,...' }
  ],
  tools: [{
    type: 'image_generation',
    quality: 'high',
    input_fidelity: 'high'  // Preserves reference face
  }]
}
```

**When to use GPT Image:**
- ‚úÖ **Best overall choice** if you have OpenAI API access
- ‚úÖ Author photos with character consistency
- ‚úÖ Complex scenes requiring instruction following
- ‚úÖ When you want text labels rendered correctly
- ‚úÖ When you want both quality AND consistency

---

### Option 3: Local ComfyUI (Advanced)

**Pros:**
- ‚úÖ Free after initial setup
- ‚úÖ Full control over workflow
- ‚úÖ Can use any models/nodes

**Cons:**
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Requires powerful GPU (RTX 3060+ recommended)
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Complex setup
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Requires manual workflow configuration

**Setup:**
1. Install ComfyUI (https://github.com/comfyanonymous/ComfyUI)
2. Install IP-Adapter nodes for face reference
3. Create workflow JSON (see `scripts/image-backends/comfyui.js`)
4. Set `.env`: `IMAGE_GEN_BACKEND=comfyui`
5. Start ComfyUI server: `python main.py --listen`

**Note:** ComfyUI backend is a framework - you need to implement your specific workflow.

---

### Option 3: Manual + Midjourney (Hybrid)

Midjourney doesn't have a public API, but you can use it manually with the generated prompts:

1. Run: `npm run image-prompts`
2. Open `scripts/image-prompts/002_author-photo.txt`
3. Copy prompt to Midjourney Discord
4. Save generated image as reference
5. For subsequent author photos, use: `--cref <image_url>`

**Manual workflow:**
```
/imagine Italian-American man in late 20s... (prompt) --ar 3:2 --v 6

# Save image URL, then for next author photo:
/imagine Same person as before, now at stove cooking... --cref <previous_url> --ar 3:2 --v 6
```

---

## Configuration Options

### `.env` Settings

```env
# API Keys
REPLICATE_API_TOKEN=r8_your_token_here

# Backend selection
IMAGE_GEN_BACKEND=replicate  # replicate, comfyui, a1111

# Reference image (auto-created)
AUTHOR_REFERENCE_IMAGE=manuscript/images/reference/author-reference.png

# Output settings
OUTPUT_WIDTH=3072
OUTPUT_HEIGHT=2048
OUTPUT_FORMAT=png

# Model selection (Replicate)
REPLICATE_FACE_MODEL=zsxkib/instant-id:latest  # For author photos
REPLICATE_PHOTO_MODEL=stability-ai/sdxl:latest # For food/general
```

---

## Character Consistency Strategy

### Phase 1: Establish Reference (Image #2)

```bash
npm run generate:images -- --single 2
```

**What happens:**
1. Reads `scripts/image-prompts/002_author-photo.txt`
2. Generates from detailed text description
3. Saves to `manuscript/images/front-matter/002_author-photo.png`
4. **Copies to `manuscript/images/reference/author-reference.png`**

### Phase 2: Generate Consistent Photos

```bash
npm run generate:author
```

**What happens:**
1. Loads reference image
2. For each author photo:
   - Converts reference to base64
   - Sends to InstantID model with:
     - Reference face image
     - New contextual prompt
     - High identity preservation (80%)
   - Saves to correct location

**Result:** All 8 author photos show the same person in different contexts.

---

## Troubleshooting

### "Author doesn't look consistent across photos"

**Solution 1:** Increase identity strength
```env
# In replicate.js, adjust these values:
identitynet_strength_ratio: 0.9  # Up from 0.8
adapter_strength_ratio: 0.9      # Up from 0.8
```

**Solution 2:** Regenerate reference photo
```bash
# Try a few variations
npm run generate:images -- --single 2
# Pick the best one as reference
```

**Solution 3:** Use manual curation
```bash
# Generate multiple candidates
for i in {1..5}; do
  npm run generate:images -- --single 2
  mv manuscript/images/front-matter/002_author-photo.png \
     manuscript/images/reference/candidate-$i.png
done

# Pick best, rename as author-reference.png
```

---

### "Image generation is too slow"

**For Replicate:**
- Generations take 20-60 seconds each
- Priority queue available with paid plan
- Can't parallelize (API rate limits)

**For Local ComfyUI:**
- Much faster with good GPU (5-15 seconds)
- Can run multiple in parallel
- Batch processing possible

---

### "Images don't match the style I want"

**Edit prompts:**
1. Modify `image-manifest.md` with desired style
2. Regenerate prompts: `npm run image-prompts`
3. Regenerate specific images: `npm run generate:images -- --single N`

**Example style adjustment:**
```markdown
# In image-manifest.md, change description to:
- More cinematic lighting
- Shot on film, 35mm, Kodak Portra 400
- Natural window light, golden hour
```

---

### "Reference image isn't working"

**Check:**
```bash
# Verify reference exists
ls -lh manuscript/images/reference/author-reference.png

# Check it's a valid image
file manuscript/images/reference/author-reference.png

# Should output: PNG image data, 3072 x 2048...
```

**If missing:**
```bash
# Manually copy any author photo as reference
cp manuscript/images/front-matter/002_author-photo.png \
   manuscript/images/reference/author-reference.png
```

## Integration with Manuscript

After generating images, add them to your markdown:

```markdown
![Author preparing scraps](images/front-matter/002_author-photo.png)
*The author in his kitchen, demonstrating the Clean-Catch method*
```

Or with figure tags for better layout:

```markdown
<figure>
  <img src="images/chapter-06/026_brown-butter-crumbs-hero.png"
       alt="Brown butter bread crumbs in jar" />
  <figcaption>
    Brown-butter bread crumbs - the foundation of dozens of recipes
  </figcaption>
</figure>
```

Then rebuild:
```bash
npm run build
```

Images will be embedded in EPUB and HTML automatically.
