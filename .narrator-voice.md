# Drain Salad - Narrator Voice Guide

**PRIVATE FILE - Character consistency reference**

## Core Identity

**Name:** Open to author preference, but voice suggests someone mid-30s to mid-40s

**Background:**
- Grew up in a working-class immigrant household (Italian-American suggested, but flexible)
- Grandmother was the family cook - zero-waste before it had a name
- Watched her save everything: parmesan rinds in the freezer, bread ends in a bag, vegetable scraps for stock
- As a kid, thought this was "poor people behavior" and was embarrassed
- Went to culinary school with student loans, worked in fine dining (3 years as garde-manger)
- Had a "come to Jesus" moment when realized fancy restaurants do the same things Nonna did, just with French names and better plating
- Left restaurant life (burned out, couldn't afford to live on those wages in a city)
- Now cooks for themselves, writes, and has made peace with the fact that Nonna was right about everything

**Financial Reality:**
- Has experienced periods of being broke (student loans, post-restaurant unemployment)
- Knows what it's like to open the fridge and genuinely need to make something from "nothing"
- But also knows the joy of having *enough* - not scarcity, but sufficiency
- This book isn't about poverty cooking; it's about intentional abundance

**Relationship to Food Waste:**
- Viscerally bothered by waste (can't throw away a lemon rind without feeling Nonna's disapproving ghost)
- But not sanctimonious about it - has thrown away moldy leftovers like everyone else
- Sees scraps as a design problem, not a moral failing
- Finds the engineering challenge fun: "How do I make kale ribs delicious?"

**Kitchen Quirks:**
- Keeps every parmesan rind (has a dedicated freezer bag)
- Cannot bring themselves to throw away stale bread (it's physically impossible)
- Has strong opinions about cutting boards (wood only, separate for meat)
- Owns exactly three good knives and thinks people who own more are showing off
- Listens to podcasts while cooking (true crime or food history, depending on mood)
- Has burned brown butter exactly 11 times and is still mad about it

**Teaching Style:**
- Assumes the reader is intelligent but inexperienced
- Explains *why* things work (the science) but doesn't condescend
- Admits failures openly ("I burned this six times before I figured out...")
- Uses humor to defuse intimidation ("You're going to feel like a raccoon eating these straight from the pan")
- Encourages improvisation once you understand the rules
- Swears occasionally but not gratuitously (just... honestly)

**Cultural Sensitivity:**
- Respects that different cultures have different scrap-cooking traditions
- Acknowledges that "zero-waste" cooking is often rebranded immigrant/working-class cooking
- Doesn't present this as a new idea - presents it as remembering what we forgot
- Aware that some readers are cooking from scarcity (respectful), others from values (also respectful)

**Voice Characteristics:**
- Wry humor, but not mean
- Self-deprecating without being annoying
- Serious about technique, playful about everything else
- Uses occasional profanity for emphasis, not shock value
- Talks directly to the reader ("You're going to...", "Here's what happens...")
- Mixes high and low references (Escoffier and Nonna in the same sentence)
- Admits uncertainty ("I don't know why this works, but it does")

**What They Care About:**
- Flavor above all else - waste reduction is a bonus, but food has to taste good
- Technique as empowerment, not gatekeeping
- Making the reader feel capable, not judged
- The quiet satisfaction of using everything
- Breaking down the false hierarchy between "fancy" cooking and "poor" cooking

**What They Don't Care About:**
- Perfection (good enough is fine)
- Trends (this isn't about being trendy, it's about being practical)
- Impressing anyone (the goal is delicious food, not Instagram likes)
- Being the authority (they're a guide, not a guru)

## Key Memories to Reference

**The Parmesan Rind Bag:**
Nonna kept a freezer bag of parmesan rinds. As a teenager, narrator thought it was gross. Now they have the same bag, and it feels like inheritance.

**The Great Brown Butter Disaster:**
First week of culinary school, burned brown butter in front of the entire class. Chef said "start over" without emotion. Learned that failure is just part of technique.

**The Bread Bag:**
Nonna had a bag hanging from a hook in the pantry where all bread ends went. Once a week, she'd make ribollita or panzanella. Narrator once threw away a bread end as a kid and got The Look. Never forgot it.

**The Staff Meal Revelation:**
Working garde-manger, realized the staff meal was always made from trim - carrot tops, kale ribs, chicken bones from butchery. The chef called it "the most honest food we make all day."

**The Broke Period:**
Post-restaurant, unemployed for 4 months. Learned to really cook from scraps, not as philosophy but as necessity. Made peace with it. Found joy in it.

**The Time They Served Drain Salad at a Dinner Party:**
Made what's now "Sludge Caesar" from wilted kale ribs and stale bread for friends. Everyone asked for the recipe. Realized scraps could be aspirational.

## Phrases & Patterns

**Opening lines:**
- "Here's the thing about [X]..."
- "Let's be honest:"
- "I learned this the hard way:"

**Transitions:**
- "But here's where it gets interesting:"
- "Now, here's what nobody tells you:"
- "The trick is..."

**Humor markers:**
- "[X] like a [unexpected comparison]" (e.g., "standing over the stove like a raccoon")
- Self-aware asides in parentheses
- Slightly absurd specificity ("exactly 11 times")

**Credibility signals:**
- "In my garde-manger days..."
- "Nonna used to..."
- "After burning this 6 times, I learned..."

**Reader connection:**
- "You know that moment when..."
- "We've all been there:"
- "If you're anything like me..."

## Topics to Avoid or Handle Carefully

- **Don't:** Preach about food waste like it's a moral failing
- **Do:** Frame it as problem-solving and flavor-maximizing

- **Don't:** Assume everyone has the same resources or time
- **Do:** Offer multiple paths (quick version, fancy version, broke version)

- **Don't:** Romanticize poverty or scarcity
- **Do:** Respect that some people cook from need, others from choice

- **Don't:** Present this as revolutionary or "hacking"
- **Do:** Frame it as remembering and honoring old knowledge

## Consistency Checks

When editing/writing, ask:
- Does this sound like a real person talking?
- Would Nonna approve of this advice?
- Is there a place for a personal memory here?
- Am I being honest about failures?
- Am I respecting the reader's intelligence?
- Is the humor helping or distracting?
- Would I actually say this out loud to a friend?
