# Publishing Infrastructure - Setup Complete! ðŸš€

## What's Been Built

Your book now has a complete publishing pipeline from manuscript to multiple distribution formats.

## New Commands Available

### Build All Formats at Once
```bash
npm run publish:all
```
Generates:
- Print-ready PDF (for KDP paperback)
- EPUB (for Kindle/e-readers)
- Optimized PDF (for Gumroad/Itch.io)

### Individual Format Builds
```bash
npm run publish:print      # Print PDF (â†’ KDP paperback)
npm run publish:epub        # EPUB (â†’ Kindle)
npm run publish:optimized   # Compressed PDF (â†’ digital sales)
```

## Files Created

### 1. Metadata (`book-metadata.json`)
Central place for all your book info:
- Title, subtitle, author
- Description, keywords
- Pricing, ISBN
- Print specifications

**Action needed**: Fill in your actual author name and details

### 2. Build Scripts
- `scripts/build-print-pdf.js` - Print-ready PDF builder
- `scripts/build-epub.js` - EPUB generator (uses Pandoc)
- `scripts/build-optimized-pdf.js` - PDF compressor (uses Ghostscript)

### 3. Typst Print Template
- `typst/book-print.typ` - Configured for print production

### 4. Publishing Guide
- `PUBLISHING.md` - Complete step-by-step guide for:
  - Amazon KDP setup
  - Gumroad/Itch.io setup
  - File requirements
  - Troubleshooting
  - Marketing copy templates

## Next Steps

### 1. Install Optional Tools

**For EPUB generation** (highly recommended):
```bash
brew install pandoc
```

**For PDF compression** (optional but nice):
```bash
brew install ghostscript
```

### 2. Customize Metadata
Edit `book-metadata.json`:
- Add your real/pen name
- Finalize description
- Set your preferred pricing
- Add ISBN (if you have one)

### 3. Test Build
```bash
npm run publish:all
```

This will create files in `build/`:
- `drain-salad-print.pdf` (8.5x11" for now, KDP will handle 6x9 trimming)
- `drain-salad.epub` (needs Pandoc)
- `drain-salad-optimized.pdf` (compressed version)

### 4. Manual KDP Upload (Learning Phase)
Follow `PUBLISHING.md` to:
1. Create KDP account
2. Upload your print PDF
3. Set pricing
4. Publish!

## What's Working

âœ… Professional orange-book Typst template
âœ… All 81 AI-generated images integrated
âœ… Print PDF build script
âœ… EPUB build script (requires Pandoc)
âœ… PDF optimization script (requires Ghostscript)
âœ… Comprehensive publishing guide
âœ… Metadata management system

## What's Next (Optional)

Once you've done one manual upload:

### Phase 2 Enhancements
- [ ] Cover generator (AI-based)
- [ ] Sample chapters extractor (first 3 chapters)
- [ ] auto-kdp integration for automated uploads
- [ ] CI/CD pipeline (auto-build on git push)
- [ ] Marketing copy generator
- [ ] ISBN management

## Current Limitations

1. **Print PDF**: Currently letter-sized (8.5x11")
   - KDP can handle this and will center for 6x9 trim
   - Future: Add post-processing for true bleed

2. **Fonts**: Using fallbacks (Georgia, Helvetica)
   - Works fine for KDP
   - Future: Install EB Garamond and Inter for perfect match

3. **Cover**: Not included yet
   - Use KDP Cover Creator for now
   - Or hire a designer
   - Future: Build cover generator

## File Sizes (Approximate)

- `drain-salad-typst.pdf`: ~298MB (original with all images)
- `drain-salad-print.pdf`: ~298MB (same, formatted for print)
- `drain-salad.epub`: ~50-100MB (compressed for e-readers)
- `drain-salad-optimized.pdf`: ~80-150MB (30-50% smaller if Ghostscript installed)

## Quick Reference

### For KDP Paperback:
```bash
npm run publish:print
# Upload build/drain-salad-print.pdf
# Select: 6x9 trim, color interior, white paper
```

### For Kindle E-book:
```bash
npm run publish:epub
# Upload build/drain-salad.epub
# Let KDP convert it
```

### For Gumroad/Itch.io:
```bash
npm run publish:optimized
# Upload build/drain-salad-optimized.pdf
# Price: $14.99-19.99 suggested
```
