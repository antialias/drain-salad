== Dedication

For Nonna, who never threw away a bread end.

And for everyone who's ever stood in front of an open fridge at 10pm, staring at scraps and wondering what the hell to make for dinner.

This is for you.

== Editor's Note

This book started as a joke.

"Drain Salad"—the idea that you could make something edible from what goes down the kitchen sink—was a bit. A provocation. A way to describe the cooking I was already doing: saving kale ribs, toasting stale bread, turning onion ends into side dishes.

But as I kept cooking this way—and as I kept feeding people these dishes and watching them ask for recipes—I realized it wasn't a joke. It was a method. A system. A way of seeing the kitchen that, once learned, you can't unsee.

This book is the method, written down.

It's for people who want to waste less, cook better, and eat well without spending a fortune. It's for broke cooks, curious cooks, and competent cooks who want a challenge. It's for anyone who's looked at a pile of vegetable scraps and thought, "There's got to be something I can do with this."

There is. This is how.

The recipes in this book are tested and real. The techniques are grounded in science and tradition. The stories are mine. The food is yours to make.

Welcome to Drain Salad.

== On the Name (Or: Yes, I Know How This Sounds)

Let's address the obvious: you're holding a cookbook called _Drain Salad_.

I know how that sounds. It sounds like a prank. It sounds like clickbait. It sounds like someone wrote an entire cookbook as an elaborate bit and hoped no one would notice.

Here's the thing: it kind of is all those things. And it's also a serious, researched, tested cookbook about transforming kitchen scraps into genuinely good food.

The name is absurd. It's supposed to be. The absurdity is what makes you stop and ask, "Wait, is this real?" And that moment—that pause—is when you start paying attention. That's when you realize that the food you throw away every day could have been dinner.

The absurdity is a feature, not a bug. Because if I'd called this book _The Resourceful Kitchen: Minimizing Food Waste Through Creative Culinary Applications_, you'd have skipped it entirely. Boring. Preachy. Another zero-waste cookbook telling you to feel bad about your compost bin.

But "Drain Salad"? That makes you curious. It makes you skeptical. It makes you want to know if I'm serious (I am) and if the recipes actually work (they do).

So yes, the name is ridiculous. The recipes are not. The techniques are grounded in culinary science, food history, and years of trial and error. The food tastes good. That's the whole point.

If you're still here, you've made it past the initial "this has got to be a joke" phase. Now we can get to the part where you discover it's also profound. That's the balance this book lives in: absurd enough to get your attention, serious enough to change how you cook.

Welcome to the tension. Let's make some food.

== A Note on Voice

This book is written in the first person. I'm not hiding behind a corporate "we" or a neutral foodwriter voice. I'm here, telling you how I learned to cook this way, why it matters, and what went wrong when I screwed it up.

Some of the stories are uncomfortable. Broke months. Bad jobs. Dinners that failed. I'm including them because they're true, and because I think honesty is more useful than polish.

If you're looking for a cheerful, aspirational cookbook with beautiful photos and no mention of money or failure, this isn't it. If you want to learn how to cook scraps into real food—and why that skill matters—keep reading.

== How to Use This Book

_If you're new to cooking:_ Start with Chapters 1–6. They'll teach you the foundations: history, technique, systems, and basic recipes. Then pick 2–3 recipes from Chapters 7–8 and make them until they're muscle memory.

_If you're a competent cook:_ Skim Chapters 1–3, read 4–6 carefully, then dive into the recipes in Chapters 7–9. The taxonomy (Chapter 10) and use cases (Chapter 11) will help you improvise.

_If you're an experienced cook looking for a challenge:_ Read the whole thing, then set a constraint: one week of meals made entirely from scraps and pantry staples. No fresh ingredients allowed. Document what you learn. That's where it gets interesting.

_Regardless of skill level:_ Bookmark Chapter 12 (Appendices). You'll come back to it when something goes wrong.

== On Recipes

The recipes in this book include precise measurements, temperatures, and times. This is intentional. I want you to succeed the first time you make them.

Once you've made a recipe a few times and understand the technique, you can start improvising. Swap scraps. Adjust ratios. Riff. The recipes are scaffolding. Eventually, you won't need them.

But for now, follow them. Trust the process. Taste as you go. Adjust to your preference. That's how you learn.

== Acknowledgments

To the chefs who taught me that staff meal is the most honest food a restaurant makes.

To the friends who ate my experiments without complaint (or at least, without too much complaint).

To Nonna, whose bread bag hangs in my pantry now.

To Simon Willison, for building LLM CLI and making it possible to get AI feedback without leaving the terminal.

To Sandor Katz, Tamar Adler, and J. Kenji López-Alt, whose books taught me that technique is more important than recipes.

To everyone who's ever asked, "Is this made from scraps?" after asking for the recipe. That's when I knew this was real.

And to you, for reading. Now go make dinner.
