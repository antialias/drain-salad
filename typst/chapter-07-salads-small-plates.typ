= Chapter 7: Salads & Small Plates

#quote[_"Start small. Start honest."_]

== On the First Bite

This is where theory becomes food.

The previous chapters gave you systems, techniques, and foundations. Now you're going to cook actual dishes—the kind you'd serve to friends, to yourself on a Tuesday night, to skeptical family members who think "drain salad" sounds like a punchline. These are not experiments. These are meals.

The salads and small plates in this chapter are designed to be entry points: straightforward, forgiving, fast. They're also modular—you can swap scraps, adjust ratios, and riff freely once you understand the structure. But the first time you make them, follow the recipe. Trust the proportions. Learn the rhythm. Then break the rules.

A note on yields: Most of these serve 2–4 people as a side, or 1–2 as a main if you're hungry or eating alone standing over the sink. Scale up as needed.

== Recipe 1: Sludge Caesar (Kale Ribs, Stale Bread, Parmesan Rinds)

=== The Story

March 2022. Six friends coming over. I have: wilted kale ribs I was going to compost, half a baguette from three days ago that's hard as a brick, and a bag of parmesan rinds in the freezer. Also \$11 in my checking account until Friday, so going to the store isn't happening.

I make this.

Someone asks for the recipe. Someone else says it's "the kind of thing you'd pay \$18 for at [restaurant name redacted]." I don't tell them it cost \$3.47 to make, or that I invented it twenty minutes before they arrived because I had no other options. That's when I learned: desperation and technique look identical on a plate.

=== The Why

This is a riff on Caesar salad, but built from scraps. The kale ribs—fibrous, bitter when raw—are blanched until tender, then tossed in a dressing made from parmesan-rind broth (umami bomb), stale bread (body and emulsification), and anchovy (funk and salt). It's rich, creamy, crunchy, and tastes like you meant to make it this way.

=== The Recipe

#hero-image("../manuscript/images/chapter-07/038_sludge-caesar-process.png", caption: [Sludge Caesar process: blanching ribs, making croutons, emulsifying dressing])

_Serves:_ 2–4 as a side, 1–2 as a main
_Active time:_ 20 minutes
_Keeps:_ Dressing: 3 days. Assembled salad: eat immediately (wilts fast).

==== Ingredients

_For the salad:_
- 2 cups (200g) kale ribs, sliced into ½-inch strips (about 2 bunches' worth)
- 2 cups (120g) stale bread, torn into 1-inch pieces
- 2 tablespoons olive oil
- ¼ teaspoon salt
- ¼ cup (25g) shaved Parmesan (or more, I won't judge)
- Flaky salt and black pepper for finishing

_For the dressing:_
- ½ cup (125ml) parmesan-rind broth (from Chapter 6, or use vegetable stock + 1 tablespoon grated Parmesan)
- 2 tablespoons finely ground toasted bread crumbs
- 1 tablespoon lemon juice
- 1 teaspoon Dijon mustard
- 2 anchovy fillets, minced (or 1 teaspoon anchovy paste)
- 1 garlic clove, grated
- ¼ cup (60ml) olive oil
- Freshly ground black pepper

==== Method

+ _Blanch the kale ribs:_ Bring a pot of salted water to a boil. Add kale ribs and cook for 2–3 minutes until just tender (they should still have some bite). Drain and immediately plunge into ice water to stop cooking. Drain again and pat very dry with a towel. Set aside.

+ _Make croutons:_ Preheat oven to 375°F (190°C). Toss bread pieces with 2 tablespoons olive oil and ¼ teaspoon salt. Spread on a baking sheet and bake for 10–12 minutes, stirring once halfway through, until deeply golden and crunchy. Let cool.

+ _Make dressing:_ In a jar or bowl, combine parmesan broth, bread crumbs, lemon juice, mustard, anchovies, and garlic. Let sit for 1 minute (the crumbs will swell). Add olive oil and shake or whisk vigorously until emulsified and creamy. Taste. It should be salty, funky, rich, and bright. Adjust: more lemon if too heavy, more oil if too sharp, more black pepper always.

+ _Assemble:_ In a large bowl, toss blanched kale ribs with half the dressing. Let sit for 2 minutes (this helps the dressing penetrate). Add croutons and toss again. The croutons should be coated but not soggy—if it looks dry, add more dressing.

+ _Finish:_ Transfer to a serving plate. Top with shaved Parmesan, flaky salt, and several grinds of black pepper. Serve immediately.

==== Variations

- _With egg:_ Top with a soft-boiled egg (6-minute egg, peeled, halved). Now it's a meal.
- _Spicy:_ Add a pinch of red chili flakes to the dressing.
- _Citrus:_ Toss in some lemon zest with the Parmesan at the end.

==== Notes

- _Why blanch the ribs?_ Raw kale ribs are too fibrous and bitter. Blanching tenderizes them and mellows the bitterness while retaining their structure.
- _Can I use other greens?_ Yes. Chard stems work. So do broccoli stems (slice thin). Cabbage cores (shaved on a mandoline) work great.
- _What if I don't have parmesan broth?_ Use vegetable stock and stir in 1 tablespoon grated Parmesan when making the dressing.

== Recipe 2: Bread-and-Tomato Salad with Pickle Brine (Panzanella Remix)

=== The Why

Panzanella is a Tuscan bread salad built on one brilliant insight: stale bread soaked in tomato juice and vinegar becomes _better_ than fresh bread. It's a dish designed to use up scraps (old bread, overripe tomatoes) and somehow ends up tasting like summer in a bowl.

This version uses tomato ends (the tough stem caps you'd normally discard), pickle brine (from a jar of cornichons or dill pickles), and whatever herbs you have lingering. It's tangy, juicy, and absurdly satisfying.

=== The Recipe

_Serves:_ 4 as a side, 2 as a main
_Active time:_ 15 minutes
_Resting time:_ 15–30 minutes (crucial—don't skip)
_Keeps:_ Best eaten day-of. Next-day leftovers are mushier but still good.

==== Ingredients

- 4 cups (240g) stale bread, torn into 1½-inch chunks (rustic bread, sourdough, baguette—anything sturdy)
- 2 cups (300g) tomato ends and scraps, seeds removed, diced\*
- ¼ cup (60ml) pickle brine (dill, bread-and-butter, or jalapeño all work)
- ¼ cup (60ml) olive oil
- 1 tablespoon red wine vinegar
- 1 garlic clove, grated
- ½ teaspoon fine sea salt
- ¼ teaspoon black pepper
- 1 cup (150g) cucumber ends or scraps, diced
- ½ small red onion, thinly sliced (or onion ends, minced)
- ¼ cup (10g) fresh basil leaves, torn (or parsley, or a mix)
- Optional: ¼ cup (30g) crumbled feta or ricotta salata

\*Tomato ends are the tough, stem-end caps. Cut away the hard core, seed them, and dice the rest.

==== Method

+ _Toast the bread (optional but recommended):_ If your bread is only slightly stale, toast the chunks in a 350°F (175°C) oven for 5–7 minutes until dry but not browned. Let cool. If your bread is very stale (rock-hard), skip this—it's already perfect.

+ _Make the dressing:_ In a large bowl, whisk together pickle brine, olive oil, red wine vinegar, garlic, salt, and pepper.

+ _Soak the bread:_ Add the bread chunks to the bowl and toss to coat. Let sit for 10 minutes. The bread will soften and absorb the dressing. It should be moist but not falling apart—if it's too dry, add a splash more olive oil. If it's too wet, let it sit longer (some moisture will evaporate).

+ _Add the rest:_ Toss in tomatoes, cucumbers, red onion, and herbs. Toss gently but thoroughly.

+ _Rest:_ Let the salad sit at room temperature for 15–30 minutes. This is key. The flavors meld, the bread continues soaking up juices, and everything becomes cohesive.

+ _Finish:_ Taste. It should be bright, tangy, juicy, and well-seasoned. Adjust: more salt, more brine, more olive oil, more pepper. If using cheese, crumble it over the top just before serving.

==== Variations

- _Winter version:_ Use roasted winter squash scraps instead of tomatoes. Add a drizzle of balsamic vinegar.
- _Spicy:_ Add sliced jalapeño or a pinch of red chili flakes.
- _Protein:_ Top with a poached or fried egg, or toss in a can of drained white beans.

==== Notes

- _Pickle brine is key:_ It's pre-seasoned acid with complexity that straight vinegar doesn't have. Don't skip it.
- _Bread texture:_ You want the bread to be moist and tender, but still holding its shape. If it turns to mush, your bread was too soft to begin with. Next time, toast it first.
- _Make ahead?_ You can prep all the components separately and assemble 30 minutes before serving. Don't assemble more than 2 hours ahead or it'll get soggy.

== Recipe 3: Crispy Potato Skins with Brown Butter and Chives

=== The Why

When you make mashed potatoes, you peel the potatoes and throw away the skins. This is insane. Potato skins crisped in a hot pan with brown butter and salt are better than most restaurant appetizers. They're crunchy, rich, salty, and deeply savory.

This is barely a recipe. It's more of a technique you'll use forever.

=== The Recipe

_Serves:_ 2–4 as a snack/appetizer
_Active time:_ 10 minutes
_Keeps:_ Best eaten immediately. Reheat in a hot oven if needed.

==== Ingredients

- Skins from 6–8 medium potatoes (russet, Yukon Gold, or red potatoes)\*
- 3 tablespoons (42g) unsalted butter
- ½ teaspoon flaky salt
- ¼ teaspoon black pepper
- 2 tablespoons minced chives (or scallion greens)
- Optional: ¼ cup (25g) grated Parmesan, sour cream for dipping

\*If your potato skins are very thin or have a lot of eyes/blemishes, this won't work as well. You want relatively intact skins with some potato flesh still attached.

==== Method

+ _Prep the skins:_ Rinse the potato skins under cold water to remove any dirt or starch. Pat them completely dry with a towel—this is crucial for crispiness.

+ _Brown the butter:_ In a large skillet (cast iron or stainless), melt butter over medium heat. Swirl occasionally until it foams, then smells nutty and turns golden-brown (3–4 minutes). Watch it closely—it goes from perfect to burnt fast.

+ _Crisp the skins:_ Immediately add the potato skins to the pan. They'll sizzle. Spread them out in a single layer (work in batches if needed—don't crowd the pan). Cook undisturbed for 2–3 minutes until the bottoms are deeply golden and crispy. Flip and cook another 2 minutes.

+ _Finish:_ Remove from heat. Sprinkle with flaky salt, black pepper, and chives. Toss. If using Parmesan, add it now while everything's still hot.

+ _Serve immediately:_ With sour cream, or just as-is. They're addictive.

==== Variations

- _Spicy:_ Toss with smoked paprika and cayenne.
- _Garlic:_ Add 2 smashed garlic cloves to the butter as it browns. Fish them out before adding skins.
- _Loaded:_ Top with crumbled bacon, sour cream, and more chives. Now it's nachos.

==== Notes

- _Make sure they're dry:_ Wet skins = soggy skins. Pat them aggressively dry.
- _High heat:_ Don't be timid. You want a hot pan so the skins crisp, not steam.
- _Save the potatoes:_ You peeled potatoes to get these skins. Make mashed potatoes with the flesh. One scrap begets another.

== Recipe 4: Charred Onion Ends with Miso and Sesame

=== The Why

Onion ends—the root base and the papery top—are usually the first thing to hit the compost. But the root end, when charred, becomes sweet, smoky, and tender. The top layers, sliced thin and sautéed, add crunch. This is a Japanese-inflected side dish that takes 10 minutes and makes you look like you know what you're doing.

=== The Recipe

_Serves:_ 2–3 as a side
_Active time:_ 10 minutes
_Keeps:_ 2 days refrigerated (reheat in a hot pan or eat cold)

==== Ingredients

- Root ends and tops from 4–5 medium onions (yellow or red), cleaned\*
- 1 tablespoon neutral oil (grapeseed, canola)
- 1 tablespoon white or yellow miso paste
- 1 teaspoon rice vinegar
- 1 teaspoon toasted sesame oil
- ½ teaspoon honey or maple syrup
- 1 tablespoon water
- 1 teaspoon toasted sesame seeds
- Optional: sliced scallion greens, red chili flakes

\*Trim off the very bottom (the hairy root plate) and the tough outer papery layers. What's left—the solid root base and the inner layers of the top—is what you'll use.

==== Method

+ _Prep the onions:_ Slice the root ends in half lengthwise (through the root). Slice the tops thinly. Keep them separate.

+ _Char the root ends:_ Heat a cast-iron or heavy skillet over high heat (no oil yet). Add the onion root halves cut-side down. Let them sit undisturbed for 3–4 minutes until deeply charred and black in spots. Don't move them—the char is flavor.

+ _Sauté the tops:_ Push the charred roots to one side of the pan. Add oil and the sliced onion tops. Sauté for 2–3 minutes until softened and starting to brown.

+ _Make the glaze:_ In a small bowl, whisk together miso, rice vinegar, sesame oil, honey, and water until smooth.

+ _Glaze:_ Pour the miso mixture into the pan. Toss everything together until the onions are coated and the glaze is clinging to them (about 1 minute). Remove from heat.

+ _Finish:_ Transfer to a plate. Sprinkle with sesame seeds, scallions, and chili flakes if using. Serve warm or at room temperature.

==== Variations

- _Add protein:_ Serve over rice with a fried egg on top.
- _Citrus:_ Add a squeeze of lime at the end.
- _Spicy:_ Drizzle with chili crisp or add gochugaru.

==== Notes

- _Char is essential:_ The charred bits add a smoky sweetness that makes this dish. Don't skip that step.
- _Miso variation:_ Use red miso for a funkier, more intense flavor. White/yellow miso is milder.
- _What about the papery layers?_ Compost those. They're too tough and bitter.

== Recipe 5: Herb-Stem Tabbouleh (Parsley Stems, Bulgur, Lemon)

=== The Why

Traditional tabbouleh is mostly parsley with a little bulgur. This version flips that: it's mostly parsley stems (minced fine) with bulgur for body. Stems have more concentrated flavor than leaves, and when dressed aggressively with lemon and olive oil, they're bright, herbaceous, and surprising.

This is excellent alongside roasted vegetables, grilled proteins, or eaten alone with a spoon while standing in front of the fridge.

=== The Recipe

_Serves:_ 4 as a side
_Active time:_ 15 minutes
_Resting time:_ 10 minutes
_Keeps:_ 2 days refrigerated (gets better as it sits)

==== Ingredients

- ¾ cup (130g) fine or medium bulgur wheat
- 1 cup (250ml) boiling water
- ½ teaspoon fine sea salt
- 2 cups (packed) parsley stems, minced very fine (about 3 large bunches' worth)
- ¼ cup (10g) parsley leaves, roughly chopped
- ¼ cup (60ml) fresh lemon juice (about 2 lemons)
- ¼ cup (60ml) olive oil
- 1 garlic clove, grated
- ¼ teaspoon black pepper
- 1 cup (150g) cherry tomato ends or scraps, diced small
- ¼ cup (30g) cucumber scraps, diced small
- 2 tablespoons minced fresh mint (optional but traditional)

==== Method

+ _Hydrate the bulgur:_ In a medium bowl, combine bulgur, boiling water, and salt. Stir, cover with a plate, and let sit for 10–15 minutes until the water is absorbed and the bulgur is tender. Fluff with a fork. Let cool slightly.

+ _Make the dressing:_ In a large bowl, whisk together lemon juice, olive oil, garlic, and black pepper.

+ _Combine:_ Add the cooled bulgur, minced parsley stems, parsley leaves, tomatoes, cucumbers, and mint (if using). Toss thoroughly. The stems should coat the bulgur like confetti.

+ _Rest:_ Let sit for 10 minutes at room temperature. The flavors will meld and the bulgur will absorb some of the dressing.

+ _Taste and adjust:_ It should be bright, lemony, and aggressively herbal. Add more lemon if flat, more olive oil if too sharp, more salt if it tastes like nothing.

+ _Serve:_ Eat at room temperature or chilled. Garnish with extra mint or a drizzle of olive oil if you're feeling fancy.

==== Variations

- _Grain swap:_ Use quinoa, farro, or cooked rice instead of bulgur.
- _Protein:_ Toss in chickpeas or crumbled feta.
- _Spicy:_ Add a pinch of Aleppo pepper or red chili flakes.

==== Notes

- _Mince the stems fine:_ If the stems are too large, they'll be fibrous and tough. You want them nearly as fine as bread crumbs.
- _Lemon is key:_ This dish should taste bright and acidic. Don't be shy.
- _Leftovers:_ This gets better the next day as the bulgur continues absorbing the dressing.

== Recipe 6: Roasted Carrot-Top Greens with Garlic and Chili

=== The Why

Carrot tops are edible. They're bitter, herbaceous, and slightly grassy—like parsley's tougher cousin. Most people throw them away because nobody told them otherwise. Roasted with garlic and chili, they're transformed into a savory, crispy side that tastes like you foraged it from a fancy farm.

=== The Recipe

_Serves:_ 2–3 as a side
_Active time:_ 10 minutes
_Keeps:_ Best eaten immediately (they get soggy)

==== Ingredients

- Tops from 1 bunch of carrots (about 2 cups loosely packed greens)\*
- 2 tablespoons olive oil
- 2 garlic cloves, thinly sliced
- ½ teaspoon red chili flakes
- ¼ teaspoon fine sea salt
- Lemon wedge for serving

\*Trim off any yellowed or slimy leaves. Rinse well—carrot tops hold dirt.

==== Method

+ _Prep the greens:_ Pat carrot tops very dry with a towel. They must be dry or they'll steam instead of crisp.

+ _Heat the pan:_ In a large skillet, heat olive oil over medium-high heat. Add garlic and chili flakes. Cook for 30 seconds until fragrant but not browned.

+ _Add greens:_ Add carrot tops and salt. Toss quickly with tongs. The greens will wilt and shrink dramatically—this is fine. Cook for 3–4 minutes, tossing occasionally, until the greens are tender and the edges are starting to crisp and char.

+ _Finish:_ Remove from heat. Squeeze lemon over the top. Taste. Adjust salt if needed.

+ _Serve immediately:_ These are best hot from the pan.

==== Variations

- _Add crunch:_ Top with toasted pine nuts or bread crumbs.
- _Creamy:_ Drizzle with tahini or a dollop of Greek yogurt.
- _Spicy:_ Add more chili flakes or a splash of hot sauce.

==== Notes

- _Are carrot tops safe to eat?_ Yes. The myth that they're toxic comes from confusion with other Apiaceae family members (like hemlock, which you're not eating). Carrot tops are safe and nutritious.
- _They're bitter:_ This is normal. The garlic, chili, and lemon balance the bitterness.
- _What about the carrots?_ Roast them. Eat them. This book is about using the whole vegetable.

== Recipe 7: Citrus-Peel Salad with Fennel and Olives

=== The Why

After you juice a lemon or orange, you're left with the spent rind. Most people compost it. But if you slice it thin—pith and all—and marinate it with olive oil, salt, and aromatics, it becomes tender, floral, and citrusy in a way that's more complex than just "lemon flavor." This is a Sicilian technique, and it's proof that scraps can be as elegant as anything else.

=== The Recipe

_Serves:_ 4 as a side
_Active time:_ 15 minutes
_Resting time:_ 30 minutes minimum (better after a few hours)
_Keeps:_ 3 days refrigerated

==== Ingredients

- 3–4 spent citrus rinds (lemon, orange, or grapefruit), juiced and hollowed\*
- 1 small fennel bulb, shaved very thin on a mandoline
- ¼ cup (50g) green or black olives, pitted and torn
- 2 tablespoons olive oil
- 1 tablespoon white wine vinegar or champagne vinegar
- ½ teaspoon fine sea salt
- ¼ teaspoon black pepper
- Pinch of red chili flakes
- 2 tablespoons fresh mint or parsley, torn
- Optional: shaved Parmesan or ricotta salata

\*Only use organic citrus if you're eating the peel. Conventional citrus is often waxed or sprayed.

==== Method

+ _Prep the citrus rinds:_ Using a sharp knife, slice the spent rinds (pith and all) into very thin strips—as thin as you can manage, almost translucent. Remove any seeds.

+ _Marinate:_ In a bowl, toss the citrus strips with olive oil, vinegar, salt, pepper, and chili flakes. Let sit for at least 30 minutes at room temperature (or up to 24 hours in the fridge). The pith will soften and mellow.

+ _Add the rest:_ Just before serving, toss in the shaved fennel, olives, and herbs. Toss gently.

+ _Taste and adjust:_ It should be bright, salty, floral, and slightly bitter (in a good way). Adjust salt or vinegar as needed.

+ _Serve:_ Top with shaved Parmesan if using. Serve at room temperature.

==== Variations

- _Winter version:_ Use blood orange rinds and add pomegranate seeds.
- _Spicy:_ Add more chili flakes or a sliced Fresno chili.
- _Grain bowl:_ Serve over farro or quinoa with a dollop of Greek yogurt.

==== Notes

- _Organic citrus only:_ Non-organic citrus peels can have pesticide residue or wax coatings. Don't risk it.
- _The pith is bitter:_ That's the point. It mellows with marinating and adds complexity.
- _Shave the fennel thin:_ Thick fennel will be too crunchy and overwhelming. Use a mandoline if you have one.

== Recipe 8: Wilted Kale Leaf Chips with Nutritional Yeast

=== The Why

When you use kale ribs for something else, you're left with a pile of leafy greens. They're wilted, past their prime, and not great raw. But baked low and slow with oil and salt, they become crispy kale chips—a snack so good you'll eat the entire batch standing over the oven.

=== The Recipe

_Serves:_ 2–4 as a snack
_Active time:_ 10 minutes
_Baking time:_ 20–25 minutes
_Keeps:_ 2 days in an airtight container (if they last that long)

==== Ingredients

- 4 cups (packed) kale leaves, ribs removed, torn into 2-inch pieces\*
- 1 tablespoon olive oil
- ½ teaspoon fine sea salt
- 2 tablespoons nutritional yeast
- Optional: ½ teaspoon garlic powder, smoked paprika, or chili powder

\*Even if they're wilted, that's fine. Just make sure they're not slimy or moldy.

==== Method

+ _Preheat oven:_ 275°F (135°C). Low and slow is key—high heat will burn them.

+ _Dry the leaves:_ Pat the kale leaves as dry as possible with a towel. Any moisture = soggy chips.

+ _Season:_ In a large bowl, toss kale with olive oil until every piece is lightly coated. Sprinkle with salt and nutritional yeast. Toss again. The leaves should look dusty, not dripping.

+ _Bake:_ Spread kale in a single layer on two baking sheets (don't crowd—they need space to crisp). Bake for 20–25 minutes, rotating the pans halfway through, until the leaves are crispy and crumble when touched. They should not be brown—if they're browning, your oven is too hot.

+ _Cool:_ Let cool on the baking sheet for 5 minutes. They'll crisp up more as they cool.

+ _Serve:_ Eat immediately, or store in an airtight container with a silica packet (to keep them crispy).

==== Variations

- _Spicy:_ Add cayenne or chili powder.
- _Cheesy:_ Add grated Parmesan with the nutritional yeast.
- _Sweet:_ Skip the nutritional yeast and toss with a tiny bit of maple syrup and cinnamon before baking (weird but good).

==== Notes

- _Low heat is essential:_ High heat burns the edges before the leaves crisp.
- _Moisture is the enemy:_ Dry the leaves thoroughly. Don't use too much oil.
- _They're delicate:_ Once baked, they shatter easily. Handle gently.

== On Building Confidence

These eight recipes are training wheels. They're structured, tested, and designed to work. But once you've made them, you'll start to see the patterns: how acid balances bitterness, how crunch adds excitement, how fat carries flavor.

That's when you stop needing recipes. You start making Drain Salads from instinct—whatever scraps you have, whatever dressing feels right, whatever crunch is on hand. The recipes are scaffolding. Eventually, you don't need the scaffolding anymore.

But for now, cook these. Learn them. Then break them.

#divider

_Photography note:_ _Each recipe should have a hero shot of the finished dish, plated simply but beautifully. Include process shots for techniques that might be unfamiliar (charring onion ends, slicing citrus rinds thin, blanching kale ribs). The aesthetic should be bright, appetizing, and unpretentious—real food, not food porn. Show the scraps in their raw form alongside the finished dish so readers can see the transformation._
