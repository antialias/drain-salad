# Image Generation Setup Guide

## Overview

This system uses **reference photos** + **descriptive prompts** to generate consistent images, especially for author photos where the same person needs to appear across multiple shots.

### Key Features

‚úÖ **Reference image support** - Use a photo to maintain character consistency
‚úÖ **Automated generation** - npm scripts manage the entire workflow
‚úÖ **Multiple backends** - Replicate API, ComfyUI, or Automatic1111
‚úÖ **Batch processing** - Generate all images with one command
‚úÖ **Progress tracking** - See generation status in real-time

---

## Quick Start (5 Minutes)

### 1. Install Dependencies

```bash
npm install
```

### 2. Set Up Configuration

```bash
# Copy the example config
cp .env.example .env

# Edit .env and add your API key
nano .env
```

Add your Replicate API token (get it from https://replicate.com/account/api-tokens):

```env
REPLICATE_API_TOKEN=r8_your_token_here
IMAGE_GEN_BACKEND=replicate
```

### 3. Generate First Author Photo (This Becomes Your Reference)

```bash
# Generate just the author bio photo (image #2)
npm run generate:images -- --single 2
```

This will:
- Use the detailed prompt from `scripts/image-prompts/002_author-photo.txt`
- Generate Italian-American man character based on detailed description
- Save to `manuscript/images/front-matter/002_author-photo.png`
- **Automatically save as reference** for all future author photos

### 4. Generate Remaining Author Photos (Will Use Reference)

```bash
# Generate all 8 author photos using the reference
npm run generate:author
```

All subsequent author photos will use image #2 as a **face reference**, ensuring the same person appears in every photo.

### 5. Generate Food Photography

```bash
# Generate all food hero shots and process sequences
npm run generate:food
```

### 6. Generate Everything Else

```bash
# Generate all priority images (25 images)
npm run generate:priority

# Or generate ALL images (82 images)
npm run generate:images
```

## How Reference Photos Work

### The Reference Photo Approach

1. **First generation** (image #2 - author bio photo):
   - Generated from detailed text description only
   - Saved as `manuscript/images/reference/author-reference.png`
   - This establishes the character

2. **Subsequent generations** (images with `type: author`):
   - Use the reference photo + new prompt
   - AI maintains facial features from reference
   - Changes only context (setting, expression, action)

### Technical Implementation

**Replicate Backend** uses **InstantID model**:
```javascript
{
  face_image: "base64_encoded_reference_photo",
  prompt: "Same person from reference, now at stove cooking...",
  identitynet_strength_ratio: 0.8,  // 80% face consistency
  adapter_strength_ratio: 0.8       // 80% style adherence
}
```

This ensures:
- Same facial structure across all photos
- Same skin tone, hair, facial features
- Only clothing, background, and pose change

## Available npm Scripts

### Generation Commands

```bash
# Generate all images
npm run generate:images

# Generate only Phase 1 priority images (25 images)
npm run generate:priority

# Generate only author photos (8 images with face reference)
npm run generate:author

# Generate only food photography (hero shots + process)
npm run generate:food

# Generate specific image by number
npm run generate:images -- --single 37

# Generate range of images
npm run generate:images -- --start 25 --end 50

# Use different backend
npm run generate:images -- --backend comfyui --author
```

## Backend Options

### Option 1: Replicate API (Recommended for Character Consistency)

**Pros:**
- ‚úÖ **Supports face reference** (InstantID model)
- ‚úÖ **Best character consistency** across author photos
- ‚úÖ Cloud-based (no local GPU needed)
- ‚úÖ Reliable, fast
- ‚úÖ Works out of the box

**Cons:**
- üíµ Costs ~$0.05-0.15 per image (~$6-12 for all 82 images)

**Setup:**
1. Sign up at https://replicate.com
2. Get API token from account settings
3. Add to `.env`: `REPLICATE_API_TOKEN=r8_...`
4. Set backend: `IMAGE_GEN_BACKEND=replicate`
5. Run: `npm run generate:priority`

---

### Option 2: OpenAI DALL-E 3 (Best Quality, No Reference Support)

**Pros:**
- ‚úÖ **Highest quality** images (often best composition/lighting)
- ‚úÖ Cloud-based (no local GPU needed)
- ‚úÖ Fast generation (30-60 seconds per image)
- ‚úÖ Natural, photorealistic style
- ‚úÖ Cheaper than Replicate (~$0.04-0.08 per image)

**Cons:**
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **No reference image support** - can't use face reference for consistency
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **Character consistency harder** - relies on detailed text descriptions only
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Max size 1792px (lower than 3072px target)
- ‚ö†Ô∏è OpenAI may revise prompts for safety/quality

**Setup:**
1. Get OpenAI API key from https://platform.openai.com/api-keys
2. Add to `.env`: `OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-...`
3. Set backend: `IMAGE_GEN_BACKEND=dalle`
4. Run: `npm run generate:priority`

**Character Consistency Workaround:**
DALL-E doesn't support reference images, but uses **very detailed character descriptions** in every prompt to maintain consistency. Results will be high quality but faces may vary slightly between photos.

**When to use DALL-E:**
- Food photography (no consistency needed)
- Single author photo (just one, so no consistency issue)
- When you prioritize image quality over perfect consistency
- When you're okay with slight variation in author appearance

---

### Option 3: Local ComfyUI (Advanced)

**Pros:**
- ‚úÖ Free after initial setup
- ‚úÖ Full control over workflow
- ‚úÖ Can use any models/nodes

**Cons:**
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Requires powerful GPU (RTX 3060+ recommended)
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Complex setup
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Requires manual workflow configuration

**Setup:**
1. Install ComfyUI (https://github.com/comfyanonymous/ComfyUI)
2. Install IP-Adapter nodes for face reference
3. Create workflow JSON (see `scripts/image-backends/comfyui.js`)
4. Set `.env`: `IMAGE_GEN_BACKEND=comfyui`
5. Start ComfyUI server: `python main.py --listen`

**Note:** ComfyUI backend is a framework - you need to implement your specific workflow.

---

### Option 3: Manual + Midjourney (Hybrid)

Midjourney doesn't have a public API, but you can use it manually with the generated prompts:

1. Run: `npm run image-prompts`
2. Open `scripts/image-prompts/002_author-photo.txt`
3. Copy prompt to Midjourney Discord
4. Save generated image as reference
5. For subsequent author photos, use: `--cref <image_url>`

**Manual workflow:**
```
/imagine Italian-American man in late 20s... (prompt) --ar 3:2 --v 6

# Save image URL, then for next author photo:
/imagine Same person as before, now at stove cooking... --cref <previous_url> --ar 3:2 --v 6
```

---

## Configuration Options

### `.env` Settings

```env
# API Keys
REPLICATE_API_TOKEN=r8_your_token_here

# Backend selection
IMAGE_GEN_BACKEND=replicate  # replicate, comfyui, a1111

# Reference image (auto-created)
AUTHOR_REFERENCE_IMAGE=manuscript/images/reference/author-reference.png

# Output settings
OUTPUT_WIDTH=3072
OUTPUT_HEIGHT=2048
OUTPUT_FORMAT=png

# Model selection (Replicate)
REPLICATE_FACE_MODEL=zsxkib/instant-id:latest  # For author photos
REPLICATE_PHOTO_MODEL=stability-ai/sdxl:latest # For food/general
```

---

## Character Consistency Strategy

### Phase 1: Establish Reference (Image #2)

```bash
npm run generate:images -- --single 2
```

**What happens:**
1. Reads `scripts/image-prompts/002_author-photo.txt`
2. Generates from detailed text description
3. Saves to `manuscript/images/front-matter/002_author-photo.png`
4. **Copies to `manuscript/images/reference/author-reference.png`**

### Phase 2: Generate Consistent Photos

```bash
npm run generate:author
```

**What happens:**
1. Loads reference image
2. For each author photo:
   - Converts reference to base64
   - Sends to InstantID model with:
     - Reference face image
     - New contextual prompt
     - High identity preservation (80%)
   - Saves to correct location

**Result:** All 8 author photos show the same person in different contexts.

---

## Troubleshooting

### "Author doesn't look consistent across photos"

**Solution 1:** Increase identity strength
```env
# In replicate.js, adjust these values:
identitynet_strength_ratio: 0.9  # Up from 0.8
adapter_strength_ratio: 0.9      # Up from 0.8
```

**Solution 2:** Regenerate reference photo
```bash
# Try a few variations
npm run generate:images -- --single 2
# Pick the best one as reference
```

**Solution 3:** Use manual curation
```bash
# Generate multiple candidates
for i in {1..5}; do
  npm run generate:images -- --single 2
  mv manuscript/images/front-matter/002_author-photo.png \
     manuscript/images/reference/candidate-$i.png
done

# Pick best, rename as author-reference.png
```

---

### "Image generation is too slow"

**For Replicate:**
- Generations take 20-60 seconds each
- Priority queue available with paid plan
- Can't parallelize (API rate limits)

**For Local ComfyUI:**
- Much faster with good GPU (5-15 seconds)
- Can run multiple in parallel
- Batch processing possible

---

### "Images don't match the style I want"

**Edit prompts:**
1. Modify `image-manifest.md` with desired style
2. Regenerate prompts: `npm run image-prompts`
3. Regenerate specific images: `npm run generate:images -- --single N`

**Example style adjustment:**
```markdown
# In image-manifest.md, change description to:
- More cinematic lighting
- Shot on film, 35mm, Kodak Portra 400
- Natural window light, golden hour
```

---

### "Reference image isn't working"

**Check:**
```bash
# Verify reference exists
ls -lh manuscript/images/reference/author-reference.png

# Check it's a valid image
file manuscript/images/reference/author-reference.png

# Should output: PNG image data, 3072 x 2048...
```

**If missing:**
```bash
# Manually copy any author photo as reference
cp manuscript/images/front-matter/002_author-photo.png \
   manuscript/images/reference/author-reference.png
```

## Cost Estimates

### Replicate (Cloud - Best for Character Consistency)

| Image Type | Cost/Image | Count | Total |
|---|---|---|---|
| Author photos (InstantID) | $0.10 | 8 | $0.80 |
| Food photography (SDXL) | $0.05 | 65 | $3.25 |
| Infographics (SDXL) | $0.05 | 9 | $0.45 |
| **Total (Priority 25)** | ‚Äî | 25 | **$2.50** |
| **Total (All 82)** | ‚Äî | 82 | **$4.50** |

Actual costs may vary. First-time users often get free credits.

### OpenAI DALL-E 3 (Cloud - Best Quality)

| Image Type | Cost/Image | Count | Total |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1024x1024 (square) | $0.040 | ‚Äî | ‚Äî |
| 1024x1792 or 1792x1024 (HD) | $0.080 | ‚Äî | ‚Äî |
| **Priority 25 (mostly landscape)** | ~$0.07 avg | 25 | **$1.75** |
| **All 82 images** | ~$0.07 avg | 82 | **$5.75** |

**Cheaper than Replicate**, but no reference image support for character consistency.

### Hybrid Approach (Recommended)

Use **DALL-E 3 for food** + **Replicate for author photos**:

| Category | Backend | Count | Cost |
|---|---|---|---|
| Author photos (need consistency) | Replicate (InstantID) | 8 | $0.80 |
| Food & other (no consistency needed) | DALL-E 3 | 74 | $5.20 |
| **Total** | Mixed | 82 | **$6.00** |

**Best of both worlds:** Character consistency where needed, best quality elsewhere.

### ComfyUI (Local)

- **Setup cost:** $0 (assuming you have compatible GPU)
- **Generation cost:** $0 (electricity only)
- **Time cost:** Higher initial setup, faster ongoing

## Advanced Usage

### Batch Processing with Custom Filters

```bash
# Generate all Chapter 6 images (foundations)
npm run generate:images -- --start 25 --end 36

# Generate all hero shots (food photography main images)
# Edit script to filter by type === 'hero'

# Generate with retry on failure
npm run generate:images -- --priority --stop-on-error
```

### Using Different Models

Edit `.env`:
```env
# For more realistic photos
REPLICATE_PHOTO_MODEL=stability-ai/sdxl:39ed52f2a78e934b3ba6e2a89f5b1c712de7dfea535525255b1aa35c5565e08b

# For more artistic style
REPLICATE_PHOTO_MODEL=playgroundai/playground-v2.5-1024px-aesthetic:latest
```

### Regenerating Specific Images

```bash
# Regenerate cover
npm run generate:images -- --single 1

# Regenerate all author photos
npm run generate:author

# Regenerate specific range (process shots)
npm run generate:images -- --start 25 --end 30
```

---

## Integration with Manuscript

After generating images, add them to your markdown:

```markdown
![Author preparing scraps](images/front-matter/002_author-photo.png)
*The author in his kitchen, demonstrating the Clean-Catch method*
```

Or with figure tags for better layout:

```markdown
<figure>
  <img src="images/chapter-06/026_brown-butter-crumbs-hero.png"
       alt="Brown butter bread crumbs in jar" />
  <figcaption>
    Brown-butter bread crumbs - the foundation of dozens of recipes
  </figcaption>
</figure>
```

Then rebuild:
```bash
npm run build
```

Images will be embedded in EPUB and HTML automatically.
