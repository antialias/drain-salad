      "prompt": "Documentary author portrait in a cramped San Francisco studio apartment kitchen, Wednesday in December 2021 at exactly 6:47 p.m. (the phone screen on the counter shows 6:47). 35mm film look, slightly desaturated warm tones, natural dusk light leaking through a small window mixes with a single warm rental-grade ceiling bulb. Three-quarter, eye-level framing: the author stands at a cheap faux-granite laminate counter, facing left, shoulders slightly hunched, caught mid-thought, not posing. Visible in the background through the open doorway: the small bathroom with a white toilet plainly in view, reminding us of the apartment’s reality. Rental-grade electric coil stove with stained drip pans, scuffed off-white fridge with a couple of old magnets, a dish rack, and a scratched cutting board front-and-center. On the board: a palmful of herb stems, three cherry tomato caps, the wilted outer leaves of a cabbage, a few bread ends—humble but noble. A thrifted chef’s knife, a dented stainless bowl nearby for scraps. Include subtle mess: a water ring on the laminate, a chipped mug, a crumpled takeout menu just out of reach. Author details for character consistency: early 30s, olive-toned skin, dark wavy hair tied back, plain gray t-shirt, dark apron, modest forearm spoon tattoo; androgynous, no glam styling. Shallow depth of field (50mm, f/2) focuses on the cutting board; the bathroom/toilet soft but unmistakable. Mood: the decision point—tension between takeout and turning scraps into dinner. Grain, gentle vignetting, natural imperfections. Color palette: warm ambers and soft daylight blues, no glossy highlights. Honest, unglamorous, candid—this is the 6:47 p.m. Wednesday moment where Drain Salad begins.",

      "prompt": "Authentic 14th-century European kitchen, documentary style, not romanticized. A large blackened cauldron hangs from an iron crane over a hearth fire at the center; embers glow orange beneath, steam and thin scum at the surface of a slow-bubbling pottage. Composition: mid-wide three-quarter view that keeps the cauldron central while including the work zone around it. Hands in action (no modern manicure): one hand drops dark, stale bread crusts; another tips in cabbage outer leaves and leek tops; a third pours pale whey from a rough earthenware pitcher. A few roasted bones (from a previous feast day) rest on a wooden trencher, ready to be added. Period-correct details: soot-blackened beams, rough stone walls, packed earth/flagstone floor strewn with rushes, a narrow leaded window admitting cold blue daylight, oak pegs holding coarse linen towels, a wooden ladle and a two-pronged flesh hook. Clothing: a scullery maid in undyed linen with a simple headwrap, a worn woolen kirtle visible on another figure at the edge of frame. No potatoes, no tomatoes, no anachronistic utensils. Light quality: warm firelight spills amber across the iron pot and hands, while dim winter daylight edges the scene with a cool rim, yielding a chiaroscuro mix that feels lived-in. 35mm film feel with mild grain, slightly desaturated earth tones—soot black, iron gray, barley beige, cabbage green, fire orange. Mood: practical survival, nothing leaves the system—yesterday’s scraps become today’s sustenance, tomorrow’s flavor. Angle approximately waist-to-chest height for an intimate but unheroic perspective. Convey the perpetual stew idea: the pot never empties, only deepens, absorbing the ghost of Sunday’s roast as the week goes on.",

      "prompt": "Circa 1933 Depression-era apartment kitchen, documentary realism, warm neutral palette with a gentle sepia cast. Close, intimate framing on a fabric bread bag hanging from a wall hook near an enamel sink. The bag is utilitarian cotton, hand-mended, bulging with bread heels and ends—dark crusts, irregular slices. A work-worn hand (no nail polish, faint flour dust) reaches in to grasp a heel. Surrounding details ground the period: a chipped white porcelain sink basin, a tin can repurposed as utensil holder, a small cast-iron skillet on an old enamel cookstove, a checkered cotton curtain fluttering near a single-pane window, a hand-crank can opener on the wall, mason jars with saved drippings and coffee grounds, a wooden cutting board scarred with knife marks, a simple calendar page curling on a nail. Light: soft midday sun through the window, dust motes visible, gentle shadows; no harsh studio gloss. Composition favors the bag and hand at center-left, with the sink and stove falling softly out of focus (shallow depth of field, 50mm, f/2.8). Mood: resourcefulness and dignity—nothing performative, no nostalgia gloss. The frame should whisper habits learned from scarcity: save the bread, reboil tomorrow. 35mm film texture with fine grain, slightly desaturated browns, creams, and muted greens. No brand labels, no modern plastics. The image should feel like an archival photograph you might discover in a family shoebox—an artifact of a practice that became inheritance: ends and crusts returning as ribollita, panzanella, or breadcrumbs.",

Wide, symmetrical composition anchored on a gleaming stainless sink with a polished disposal flange. To the right of the sink, a small chrome toggle switch plate neatly labeled “Disposal.” A manicured hand hovers near the switch, about to flip it. Counters are spotless pastel Formica with a subtle boomerang pattern; cabinets are glossy aqua and butter-yellow with chrome pulls. No visible scraps anywhere—just perfectly packaged foods lined with intention: a generic TV dinner in an aluminum tray, a box labeled “Instant Potatoes,” a jar of dehydrated onion flakes, a box of “Bouillon Cubes,” a loaf of uniformly sliced white bread in plastic, a tower of canned soups with tidy paper labels. Background details: a starburst clock, a sunburst wall decoration, a rounded-edge refrigerator, a tidy roll of paper towels, atomic-pattern curtains. Color palette: saturated mid-century optimism—mint, coral, butter, chrome—no stains, no patina. Mood: out of sight, out of mind—the moment food scraps became trash with the flip of a switch. 35mm color film vibe but crisper and more saturated than the other images to emphasize the era’s glossy promise. Camera at counter height, straight-on, slight wide angle (35mm) to exaggerate the immaculate geometry. Emphasize reflections on chrome and the absence of mess.

Eye-level, three-quarter wide shot of 5–7 cooks gathered around a stainless prep table, some perched on milk crates, some standing. The food is family-style and specific: a hotel pan of roasted vegetable ends (carrot nubs, onion ends, kale ribs glistening with oil), a big braiser of day-old-rice fried rice flecked with herb stems, a stockpot of brothy soup set on a trivet with bones visible, a bowl of panzanella built from bread heels and wrinkled tomatoes, deli quarts labeled in Sharpie “Carrot Top Chimichurri” and “Kale Rib Slaw.” Plates are mismatched, utensils are utilitarian. Background: speed rack, stacked Cambros, a line with heat lamps, expo tickets curled in a holder, a back door letting in cool daylight that mixes with warm overhead fluorescents. The chef—crisp whites, arms crossed—stands slightly out of focus at the edge, not smiling, watching. Light is real kitchen light: mixed color temperature, pockets of shadow, no polish. 35mm film feel, slight grain, gently desaturated steel blues and warm skin tones. Composition keeps faces candid—mid-bite, passing a pan, heads down—no staged smiles. Emphasize the textures: crusty bread heels soaking vinaigrette, crisp kale ribs, glossy rice grains, the sheen of reduced stock. Mood: camaraderie and urgency—a 20-minute pause before service, and the most honest food they make all day. No visible brands, no food styling tricks; just resourcefulness turned delicious.",

Add subtle, hand-torn masking tape labels near each bowl, handwritten: Fines, Chunks, Ballast, Acid, Fat, Crunch.

Add a small footer note: “When in doubt, compost. Keep scraps away from the sink. Label and refrigerate within 30 minutes.” Layout should be balanced, airy, and instructional, not clinical; no heavy shadows or glossy effects. Ensure all labels are legible at cookbook page size.",

The author—same subject as prior author photo (lean build, short dark hair, rectangular black-frame glasses, worn navy apron over a threadbare gray t-shirt)—stands at the cheap laminate counter, shoulders slumped, staring at a failed scrap project: a cloudy glass jar of vegetable scraps with fuzzy white mold blooming on the surface. The jar sits too close to the sink, a bad idea made visible by a damp, cluttered basin in soft focus. Emotion: frustration, a little shame, but also grim determination. Include details of the rental-grade kitchen: off-white apartment fridge, coil-burner stove, slightly peeling cabinet veneer, a single overhead bulb casting hard shadows. In the background, the bathroom door is ajar; the toilet is plainly visible from the kitchen, reinforcing the unglamorous reality. On the counter: a roll of masking tape and a marker left unused, a hint that labeling and refrigeration were skipped. No posing—catch the author mid-breath, hands hovering near the jar as if deciding whether to toss it.

Composition: counter-height 3/4 view with shallow depth of field (50mm, f/2), focus on five items lined up on a cheap, speckled laminate countertop beside a dented rental-grade electric coil stove. The five essentials: a half-full green-glass bottle of olive oil; a budget red wine vinegar in a clear bottle; a small bottle of soy sauce; a scuffed red-and-white box of kosher salt with a few crystals spilled; one lemon half, visibly squeezed with ragged pulp and fragrant zest, the other half off to the side. In the soft blur: the bathroom door ajar reveals a small white toilet in direct sightline of the stove, a thin towel hanging on a cheap hook, a chipped mirror catching a sliver of light. A battered microwave over the stove shows 6:47 in cold green digits. The author—same person as author photo 002, maintain identical facial features and build for character continuity—stands half in frame, not posed, wearing a faded black T-shirt, messy short hair, tired but focused eyes. One hand grazes the lemon; the other anchors on the counter near a cracked-screen phone displaying a bank balance reading $11.73 (no brand logos). Mood: bare, honest, defiant resourcefulness.

Composition: medium close-up at counter height, shallow depth of field (f/2.0). Foreground in crisp focus: a quart mason jar in the author’s hands, filled with kale ribs and brine. Show a thin white film (kahm yeast) across the surface and a small, unmistakable fuzzy green mold patch clinging to the brine line in one corner. Several kale ribs are floating above the brine (no weight used), illustrating the mistake. A strip of masking tape on the jar reads: “Kale ribs – 2% – 6/19/21.” The author’s face is in soft focus behind the jar, eyes narrowed, ambivalent and a touch defeated, breathing in a not-tangy, faintly off smell. Background details: cheap laminate counter, rental-grade coil electric stove, dented saucepan, stained cutting board, a chipped mug, and—crucially—the bathroom door ajar so the toilet is visible down the same line of sight as the stove.

      "prompt": "Create a horizontal, educational infographic titled “Oven Temperature Visual Guide,” warm, editorial cookbook style. Background: soft, neutral paper tone with daylight shadows; minimal, warm palette. Layout: an 8-tile row (or a 2x4 grid) showing the same sheet pan of cubed root vegetables (carrots, potatoes, onions) roasted at different oven settings. Each tile has a small, clean label with Fahrenheit, Celsius, and Gas Mark. Temperatures to include exactly: 250°F (120°C, Gas 1/2), 300°F (150°C, Gas 2), 325°F (160°C, Gas 3), 350°F (175°C, Gas 4), 375°F (190°C, Gas 5), 400°F (200°C, Gas 6), 425°F (220°C, Gas 7), 450°F (230°C, Gas 8). Visual cues per tile after the same time in the oven: 250°F—pale, soft, barely colored; 300°F—gentle drying, minimal browning; 325°F—light caramelization on edges; 350°F—uniform golden; 375°F—deeper browning, some crisp edges; 400°F—bold browning, visible steam; 425°F—hero tile: deeply bronzed, blistered edges, crisped tips, glistening with rendered oil; 450°F—darker char in spots, edges nearing burnt. Include a thin slider-like bar or legend under the tiles mapping Fahrenheit to Celsius and Gas Mark icons, clean sans-serif type, monospaced numerals. Lighting within the food tiles: soft natural window light from the left, minimal reflections, realistic textures (not glossy food porn). No brand logos, no over-styling. The overall mood: practical field-guide clarity—so a home cook can glance and know what 425°F should look like on roasted vegetables.",

      "prompt": "Cookbook reference infographic titled “Scrap Storage Guide,” with a warm field-guide aesthetic. Two clear columns: left labeled “Refrigerator” (blue-gray accent), right labeled “Freezer” (muted teal accent). Background: soft cream paper with subtle grain; natural daylight shadows; clean, organized layout. Show real quart deli containers and small jars photographed top-down and front-on, neatly arranged on a grid. Handwritten masking tape labels (thick black marker, legible) on each container with exact times. Refrigerator column containers labeled: “Vegetable scraps (raw) — 24–48 hours,” “Greens & herbs — 24 hours,” “Bread ends (untoasted) — 2–3 days,” “Cheese rinds — 1 week,” “Citrus peels — 1 week,” “Cooked grains — 5 days,” “Roasted vegetables — 3–4 days,” “Fermented vegetables — 3+ months,” “Stocks/broth — 5 days.” Freezer column containers labeled: “Vegetable scraps (raw) — 3 months,” “Bread ends — 3 months,” “Cheese rinds — indefinitely,” “Citrus peels — 6 months,” “Stocks/broth — 3 months,” “Cooked grains — 3 months,” “Brown-butter crumbs — 2 months.” Add small, unobtrusive icons at the top of each column: a simple fridge outline and a snowflake. Visual cues: slight condensation on refrigerated containers, thin frost patina on freezer containers. Color palette: ink-gray text (#333333), muted olive dividers (#6B7B4D), and restrained accent colors. Keep it unpretentious and real—containers can have minor scratches and water spots, but the overall layout is crisp and instructional. No brand logos, no sterile medical vibes. Make the times easy to read at a glance, like a chart you’d tape inside a cabinet door.",

Two bold columns labeled “Correct” (muted green check) and “Incorrect” (rust red X), with two rows of photographic close-ups that match the book’s honesty. Row 1: Fermentation. Left (Correct): a clear quart jar of kale ribs fully submerged under brine, a glass weight pressing vegetables below the liquid line, no fuzz, possibly a faint, thin white film being skimmed—labeled “Fully submerged, 2–2.5% salt brine, clean tools.” Right (Incorrect): a jar with floating vegetable bits poking above the brine and visible fuzzy green/black mold on the surface—labeled “Exposed veg + weak brine = mold. Discard.” Row 2: Bread crumbs. Left (Correct): sheet pan of evenly toasted, golden-brown coarse bread crumbs, dry and sandy, steam lines gone; a note reading “Cool completely before storing.” Right (Incorrect): pale, clumped, greasy crumbs in a fogged plastic container with visible condensation droplets—labeled “Stored warm = soggy.” Background: soft cream paper with daylight shadows, not sterile; typography: clean sans-serif headings, monospaced numerals/notes; restrained color palette (ink gray text, muted olive rules, red/green accents). Include thin arrows or callouts pointing to key details (liquid line, mold fuzz, condensation). Camera look: natural window light from the left, f/5.6 for clarity, slightly desaturated, realistic textures. No glossy food styling—just honest, educational visuals that make the differences obvious at a glance.",
