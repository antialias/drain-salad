# Chapter 11: Use Cases

> *"Context is everything."*

## On Application

This book has given you theory, technique, and recipes. Now comes the practical question: *when* do you actually use this?

Drain Salad cooking isn't an all-or-nothing proposition. You're not converting to a new religion. You're adding a tool to your repertoire—a way of seeing your kitchen that makes you more resourceful, more efficient, and arguably a better cook.

This chapter maps Drain Salad techniques onto real-life situations. Some are daily (weeknight dinners, meal prep). Some are occasional (dinner parties, travel). Some are circumstantial (broke, busy, cleaning out the fridge). All of them benefit from understanding how to cook from scraps.

## Use Case 1: The Sunday Meal-Prep Session

**Situation:** You have 2–3 hours on Sunday afternoon. You want to set yourself up for easy weeknight dinners.

**Drain Salad strategy:**

1. **Cook grains in bulk:** Make 4–6 cups of farro, rice, or quinoa. Store in the fridge in portioned containers. These will be the base for grain bowls all week.

2. **Roast a big batch of scraps:** Toss all your vegetable scraps (carrot peels, kale ribs, squash trim, broccoli stems) with olive oil, salt, and pepper. Roast at 425°F (220°C) for 25–30 minutes. Store in the fridge.

3. **Make two foundations:** Brown-butter bread crumbs and crumb-vinaigrette (Chapter 6). These last all week and make everything better.

4. **Optional: Start a ferment:** If you have a lot of scraps, start a batch of lacto-fermented vegetables. By Wednesday, you'll have tangy pickles to top grain bowls.

**Monday–Friday:** Assemble bowls in 5 minutes: grains + roasted scraps + dressing + crunch (bread crumbs). Add a fried egg if you want protein. Dinner is done.

**Why this works:** You're front-loading the labor. Weeknights, you're just assembling components, not cooking from scratch.

## Use Case 2: The "I'm Broke Until Friday" Week

**Situation:** It's Tuesday. Payday isn't until Friday. You have $11 in your checking account and a fridge full of scraps.

**Drain Salad strategy:**

1. **Take inventory:** What scraps do you have? Wilted greens? Stale bread? Onion ends? Parmesan rinds? List everything.

2. **Make stock or soup:** Combine all your scraps in a pot with water, salt, and a spoonful of miso. Simmer for 30 minutes. You now have 6 cups of soup that cost $0.

3. **Make bread-based dishes:** If you have stale bread, make panzanella or bread pudding. Bread + scraps + eggs/cheese = a meal that feels substantial.

4. **Stretch with grains:** If you have dry rice, pasta, or beans in the pantry, cook them and use scraps as the "topping." A small amount of scraps + a lot of grain = full stomach.

**Why this works:** Scraps are free. You've already paid for them when you bought the original vegetables. Using them is pure profit.

**Personal note:** This was me, November 2021 to March 2022. Four months of this. Every meal was scraps + pantry staples. I didn't starve. I didn't eat badly. I learned more about cooking in those four months than I did in two years of school.

## Use Case 3: The Dinner Party

**Situation:** You're hosting 6–8 people. You want to impress them without spending $200 on groceries.

**Drain Salad strategy:**

1. **Lead with a showstopper:** Make Sludge Caesar (Chapter 7) or the upside-down savory cake with caramelized onion ends (Chapter 8). These are made from scraps but look and taste like you meant it.

2. **Serve ferments as a "cheese plate":** Arrange lacto-fermented vegetables, herb-stem chimichurri, and citrus-peel marmalade on a board with crackers and cheese. Call it "house preserves." People will think you're fancy.

3. **Make a gratin as the main:** Bread-and-kale-rib gratin (Chapter 8) or savory bread pudding. It's rich, feeds a crowd, and can sit in the oven while you socialize.

4. **Don't mention scraps:** Seriously. Call it "ember salad" or "rustic gratin" or "preserved vegetables." The food is good enough to stand on its own. You don't need to justify it.

**Why this works:** Drain Salad techniques—roasting, fermenting, emulsifying—produce restaurant-quality results. You're not serving scraps. You're serving food that happens to be made from scraps.

**Personal story:** March 2022. Six friends. $3.47 dish. Someone asked for the recipe. That's when I knew this was real.

## Use Case 4: The "Fridge Cleanout Before Travel" Night

**Situation:** You're leaving town tomorrow morning. Your fridge has odds and ends that will spoil while you're gone.

**Drain Salad strategy:**

1. **Make a big frittata:** Sauté all your vegetable scraps (greens, alliums, whatever), mix with beaten eggs, bake. Eat half for dinner, pack half for the plane/road trip.

2. **Quick-pickle anything that's borderline:** Cucumber ends, carrot nubs, radish tops—slice thin, cover with brine (vinegar + water + salt + sugar), refrigerate. They'll last 2–3 weeks.

3. **Freeze scraps you can't use:** Stale bread, cheese rinds, herb stems—all go in the freezer in labeled bags. You'll thank yourself when you get home.

**Why this works:** You're not wasting food or money. You're converting perishables into either meals or preserved items.

## Use Case 5: The Weeknight "I Have 20 Minutes" Dinner

**Situation:** It's 7:30pm. You're tired. You need to eat something that isn't takeout.

**Drain Salad strategy:**

1. **Pasta with brown-butter crumbs and scraps (Chapter 8):** Boil pasta. Brown butter, add bread crumbs. Toss. Add wilted kale ribs or roasted vegetable trim if you have it. Total time: 15 minutes.

2. **Grain bowl with whatever:** Leftover rice or farro + sautéed scraps + any dressing + any crunch. Total time: 10 minutes if grains are pre-cooked.

3. **Fried eggs over anything:** Sauté scraps in a pan. Crack eggs on top. Cover and cook until whites set. Eat with toast. Total time: 10 minutes.

**Why this works:** These aren't "projects." They're fast, simple, and use what you already have.

## Use Case 6: The "I'm Cooking for One" Reality

**Situation:** You live alone. Recipes serve 4–6. You end up with too many scraps or too much food.

**Drain Salad strategy:**

1. **Embrace small batches:** Most Drain Salad recipes scale down easily. Make 1 serving of pasta with crumbs. Make a 2-egg frittata in a small pan.

2. **Freeze in portions:** If you make a batch of soup or gratin, portion it into single servings and freeze. Future you will appreciate this.

3. **Use scraps for condiments:** One person doesn't generate enough scraps for a daily salad, but you can accumulate them over a week and make ferments or relishes that last months.

**Why this works:** Cooking for one is about systems, not recipes. Build a system where scraps accumulate into something useful over time.

## Use Case 7: Feeding Kids (or Skeptical Adults)

**Situation:** You have people in your household who are suspicious of "scraps."

**Drain Salad strategy:**

1. **Don't call it Drain Salad:** Call it pasta, grain bowl, frittata—whatever it is. The name matters.

2. **Focus on familiar formats:** Kids (and skeptical adults) are more likely to eat something that looks normal. Gratin, pasta, tacos—these are recognizable. Lead with those.

3. **Bury the scraps:** Mix kale ribs into pasta with lots of Parmesan. Hide carrot peels in soup. Blend roasted scraps into tomato sauce. They'll never know.

4. **Make it crunchy:** Kids especially love crunch. Bread crumbs, crispy potato skins, fried vegetable peelings—these are universally appealing.

**Why this works:** You're not asking people to change their preferences. You're just quietly using scraps in formats they already like.

## Use Case 8: The Post-Holiday Fridge Chaos

**Situation:** It's December 27th. Your fridge has: half a roasted turkey, wilted herbs, stale dinner rolls, three kinds of cheese, and vegetable scraps from making stuffing.

**Drain Salad strategy:**

1. **Make stock from bones:** Turkey carcass + vegetable scraps + water. Simmer for 2 hours. You now have turkey stock for soup, risotto, or freezing.

2. **Turn stale rolls into bread crumbs or panzanella:** Toast them or soak them in dressing.

3. **Make herb-stem chimichurri:** All those parsley, sage, and thyme stems from garnishes? Chimichurri. It'll last 2 weeks and make leftovers taste less sad.

4. **Frittata or grain bowl with everything:** Turkey + scraps + grains + dressing = a meal that doesn't feel like leftovers.

**Why this works:** Post-holiday food waste is depressing and expensive. Drain Salad techniques turn chaos into meals.

## Use Case 9: Learning to Cook

**Situation:** You're new to cooking. You want to improve but don't know where to start.

**Drain Salad strategy:**

Start here. Seriously.

Drain Salad cooking teaches you:
- **Knife skills:** Mincing herb stems, shaving kale ribs, dicing scraps fine.
- **Seasoning:** Scraps have muted flavors, so you learn to salt, acid, and fat aggressively.
- **Timing:** Blanching kale ribs, browning butter, caramelizing onions—these are fundamental techniques.
- **Improvisation:** You can't follow a recipe exactly because you don't know what scraps you'll have. You learn to adapt.

**Why this works:** Drain Salad cooking is low-stakes. If you mess up, you're only wasting scraps, not $30 worth of ingredients. It's practice with training wheels.

## Use Case 10: The "I Actually Love Cooking and Want a Challenge" Scenario

**Situation:** You're a competent cook. You want to push yourself.

**Drain Salad strategy:**

1. **Set a constraint:** For one week, make every meal exclusively from scraps and pantry staples. No fresh ingredients allowed except what you already have.

2. **Experiment with fermentation:** Start multiple ferments with different spice profiles. Compare results. Learn what you like.

3. **Invent a signature dish:** Take a scrap you normally throw away (broccoli stems, squash skins, whatever) and develop a dish around it. Refine it until it's restaurant-quality.

4. **Document everything:** Take photos, write notes, track what works and what doesn't. Build your own personal Drain Salad cookbook.

**Why this works:** Constraints breed creativity. When you can't rely on "just buy better ingredients," you have to rely on technique. That makes you a better cook.

## On Living With Drain Salad Cooking

This isn't a diet or a challenge or a month-long experiment. It's a way of seeing your kitchen that, once learned, you can't unsee.

You'll still buy groceries. You'll still cook "normal" food. But you'll also catch yourself saving kale ribs instead of composting them. You'll make bread crumbs from the heels nobody wants. You'll turn onion ends into a side dish without thinking about it.

It becomes habit. Not because you're trying to be virtuous or frugal, but because the food tastes good and the system works.

That's when you know it's stuck.

**Photography note:** *This chapter should feel documentary and real. Include: (1) a meal-prep spread showing containers of grains, roasted scraps, and dressings; (2) a "broke week" fridge with only scraps and pantry staples (before) and a finished meal (after); (3) a dinner party table with Drain Salad dishes plated elegantly; (4) a timeline showing scraps accumulating over a week and then being used. The aesthetic should be relatable and aspirational—real kitchens, real situations, real solutions.*
