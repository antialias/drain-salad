description: |
  Every kitchen hides an ecosystem of quiet abundance. Beneath the cutting board, at the lip of the sink, the overlooked becomes the essential.

  Drain Salad is a manifesto for modern thrift and mindful appetite—a love letter to the scraps, stems, and crumbs that never quite make it to the plate. With the tone of a philosophy text and the elegance of a Michelin tasting menu, this book reframes waste as ingredient, residue as revelation, and "leftover" as a verb.
