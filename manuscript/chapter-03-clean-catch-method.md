# Chapter 3: Procurement & Hygiene — The Clean-Catch Method

> *"We don't rescue food from drains—we prevent it from going there."*

## On the Name (And Why We're Not Actually Eating From Drains)

OK. Let's talk about the name.

The book is called *Drain Salad*. I know. You bought a book called *Drain Salad* and now you're sitting here wondering if this is an elaborate prank, or if I've genuinely lost my mind, or possibly both. These are fair questions.

Here's the situation: We are not eating from the actual drain. We're not scraping biofilm off pipes. We're not fishing vegetable scraps out of the sink trap. That would be both disgusting and medically inadvisable, and also I'm pretty sure illegal in most jurisdictions.

What we're doing—what this entire book is about—is intercepting scraps *before* they reach the drain. That's the "Clean-Catch" part. We're catching them upstream, while they're still clean food, before they touch the sink basin or get contaminated by the general disaster zone that is most people's kitchen sinks.

**Legal disclaimer time:** Kitchen sinks are microbiological nightmares. A 2019 USDA study found that 34% of kitchen sinks test positive for bacterial contamination—more than any other surface. Sinks develop biofilms (sticky bacterial colonies that resist cleaning), become splash zones for aerosolized *Salmonella* and *Campylobacter*, and generally host a party of pathogens you do not want to eat. The CDC explicitly warns against rinsing raw chicken in sinks for this reason. So: if food has touched the sink basin, the drain, or a drain filter, don't eat it. Compost it. Throw it away. Feed it to your neighbor's chickens. Whatever. Just don't eat it.

**End legal disclaimer.**

Now that we've established I'm not trying to poison you or get sued, let's talk about the actual system.

## The Solution: Capture Before Contact

The Clean-Catch Method is built on one simple principle: **intercept scraps before they reach the sink.**

Instead of letting edible offcuts fall wherever they may—onto the cutting board, into the sink, circling the drain—we deliberately capture them *upstream*, in a dedicated, food-only container. This keeps scraps in the *food system* (safe, intentional, hygienic) rather than the *waste system* (contaminated, haphazard, headed for oblivion).

Think of it as *mise en place* for your scraps. In a professional kitchen, every ingredient has its place: diced onions in one container, minced garlic in another, herbs picked and ready. The Clean-Catch Method extends this logic to offcuts. Your herb stems don't go in the trash—they go in the scrap bin, where they'll become tomorrow's pesto. Your bread ends don't hit the compost—they go in the bread container, where they'll become croutons or crumbs.

This is not about being fussy. It's about maintaining a clear boundary between *food* (which we treat with care and intention) and *waste* (which we discard responsibly). Once that boundary blurs—once scraps touch the sink or trash—they're no longer food. The Clean-Catch Method keeps that boundary bright.

## The Setup: Three Configurations for Every Kitchen

There's no single "correct" Clean-Catch setup. What works in a tiny apartment galley kitchen won't work in a sprawling suburban kitchen with an island. Below are three configurations, ranging from minimal to elaborate. Choose the one that fits your space, budget, and cooking volume.

### Configuration 1: The Minimalist (Budget: $10–$25)

**What you need:**
- One fine-mesh stainless steel strainer (6–8 inches diameter)
- One medium mixing bowl (2–3 quarts)
- Two to three clear deli containers with lids (quart-sized)
- One roll of masking tape and a permanent marker for labeling

**How it works:**
Place the strainer inside the mixing bowl and set it on your counter, *away from the sink*—ideally next to your cutting board. As you prep, scraps go into the strainer. The bowl underneath catches any liquid. Every 30 minutes (or when you finish prepping), transfer the scraps from the strainer into labeled deli containers (e.g., "Veg Scraps – 10/15," "Bread Ends – 10/14") and refrigerate immediately.

**Pros:** Cheap, portable, takes up almost no space. You probably already own most of this.
**Cons:** Requires frequent attention—you can't just let scraps pile up all day. Best for small households or occasional Drain Salad makers.

**Hygiene notes:**
- Wash the strainer and bowl with hot, soapy water after each use.
- Sanitize weekly with a diluted bleach solution (1 tablespoon bleach per gallon of water) or run through the dishwasher.

### Configuration 2: The Counter Station (Budget: $40–$80)

**What you need:**
- One large stainless steel or bamboo prep bowl (4–6 quarts) with an integrated colander or strainer insert
- One small cutting board (8x10 inches) with a built-in scrap chute or carved channel
- A set of stackable, labeled deli containers (1-pint and 1-quart sizes)
- A dedicated shelf or drawer in your fridge for scrap storage

**How it works:**
Set up a permanent "scrap station" on your counter, positioned next to your main cutting board but well away from the sink (minimum 18 inches). The small cutting board with a scrap chute angles directly into the prep bowl, so scraps slide off as you work—no need to scrape them off manually. Every couple of hours, sort scraps from the prep bowl into labeled containers (e.g., "Greens," "Alliums," "Bread," "Mixed Veg") and refrigerate.

**Pros:** More ergonomic—scraps flow naturally from board to bowl. Encourages sorting, which makes cooking later easier.
**Cons:** Takes up counter space. Requires buy-in from anyone else who uses the kitchen.

**Optional upgrades:**
- A small compost pail with a charcoal filter for true non-edible waste (bones from meat, citrus rinds you've already zested and juiced, moldy items).
- A label maker for container lids—much cleaner than masking tape.

**Hygiene notes:**
- Wash all components daily.
- Keep raw animal products (meat, poultry, seafood) completely separate. If you're breaking down a chicken, those scraps (skin, fat, bones) go into a *different* container, never mixed with vegetable scraps. Ideally, process them immediately into stock.

### Configuration 3: The Pro Setup (Budget: $150–$300)

**What you need:**
- A custom or semi-custom counter insert: a cutting board that fits over a pull-out drawer or a built-in scrap trough
- Multiple stainless steel or glass prep bowls (various sizes) that nest inside the drawer or trough
- A small, dedicated prep fridge or a wine fridge repurposed for scrap storage
- Color-coded containers and/or a label system with date coding
- Optional: a vacuum sealer for longer-term scrap storage

**How it works:**
This is the setup for someone who cooks daily and is serious about zero-waste. The integrated cutting board has a hole or channel that drops scraps directly into sorted bins below. You're sorting in real-time: greens in one bin, alliums in another, bread in a third. At the end of each day, you seal or refrigerate the bins. Once or twice a week, you cook through them.

**Pros:** Maximum efficiency. Sorting happens automatically, so there's less decision fatigue. Great if you're cooking for a family or entertaining frequently.
**Cons:** Expensive. Requires either custom carpentry or significant adaptation of existing cabinetry. Not renter-friendly.

**Optional upgrades:**
- A small sous-vide setup for rendering fats and making stocks from scrap bones.
- A dehydrator for drying herb stems, vegetable peelings, and bread into shelf-stable "dust" that can be stored for months and rehydrated as needed.

**Hygiene notes:**
- Everything should be stainless steel or tempered glass—materials that can withstand high-heat sanitizing.
- Run a full sanitize cycle at least twice a week.
- Keep a separate cutting board and knife for raw animal products. Never cross-contaminate.

## The Workflow: How to Operate the Clean-Catch System

Regardless of which configuration you choose, the workflow is the same:

### Step 1: Set the Stage (Before You Start Cooking)

- Sanitize your cutting board, knife, and scrap containers. Use hot, soapy water and rinse thoroughly, or run them through the dishwasher.
- Place your scrap strainer/bowl on the counter, *away from the sink*.
- Lay out labeled containers if you're sorting (Greens, Bread, Alliums, Mixed Veg, etc.).

### Step 2: Capture as You Prep

- As you trim, peel, chop, and portion, deposit edible scraps directly into the scrap container.
- **Edible scraps include:** vegetable trim, herb stems, bread ends, fruit peels (if organic and washed), wilted greens, allium ends (cleaned), cheese rinds, citrus zest/rinds after juicing.
- **Not edible/not safe:** anything that touched raw meat or seafood, moldy items, avocado pits, large seeds, allium skins (the papery outer layer—compost those), non-organic citrus peels (often waxed).

### Step 3: Chill Promptly (Within 30 Minutes)

- Transfer scraps from the catch bowl into labeled containers.
- Write the date on the container with a marker.
- Refrigerate immediately. The USDA's "danger zone" for bacterial growth is 40–140°F. Scraps left at room temperature for more than two hours (one hour if it's warm in your kitchen) should be discarded or cooked through.

### Step 4: Use or Process Within 48 Hours

- Vegetable scraps: 24–48 hours in the fridge. If they start to smell off or get slimy, compost them.
- Bread ends: 2–3 days, or freeze them. Stale is fine; moldy is not.
- Greens and herbs: 24 hours max. They wilt fast.
- Cheese rinds and citrus peels: up to a week, or freeze.

If you're not ready to cook, you have two options:
1. **Freeze:** Most scraps freeze well. Bread, vegetable trim, cheese rinds, and citrus peels can all go in the freezer in labeled bags. Frozen scraps are perfect for stocks, stews, and baked dishes.
2. **Cook through:** Turn scraps into a foundation (stock, crumb-vinaigrette, fermented relish) that lasts longer than the raw scraps would.

### Step 5: Sanitize After Use

- Wash all components with hot, soapy water.
- Once a week, sanitize with a bleach solution (1 tablespoon bleach per gallon of water, let sit for 1 minute, rinse thoroughly) or run through the dishwasher on the sanitize cycle.

## Absolute No-Go Items (Non-Negotiable)

Some things should never enter your Clean-Catch system, no matter how thrifty you're feeling:

1. **Anything that touched raw meat, poultry, or seafood.** The risk of cross-contamination is too high. If you're breaking down a chicken, those scraps go directly into a stock pot or the trash—never into the scrap bin with vegetable trim.

2. **Moldy items.** Even if you cut away the visible mold, spores can penetrate deeper than you think. Compost it.

3. **Egg shells.** They can harbor *Salmonella*. Compost or trash.

4. **Anything that smells off, even slightly.** Trust your nose. If it smells wrong, it *is* wrong.

5. **Non-organic citrus peels (unless thoroughly scrubbed).** Many are coated with wax or pesticide residue. If you're going to zest them or candy them, make sure they're organic or very well-washed.

6. **Allium skins (the papery outer layers).** They don't break down well in cooking and add bitterness. Compost them.

7. **Large pits and seeds.** Avocado pits, stone fruit pits, apple cores (the seeds contain trace amounts of cyanide—probably harmless in small amounts, but why risk it?).

## Troubleshooting: Common Issues and Fixes

### Problem: My scraps smell funky after one day in the fridge.

**Diagnosis:** Either they weren't fresh to begin with, or they got contaminated during handling.

**Fix:** Check your source vegetables—if they were already borderline, their scraps won't last either. Also, make sure your scrap containers are truly clean. Run them through the dishwasher or hand-wash with hot, soapy water and dry completely before use.

**Prevention:** Use scraps from fresh, high-quality ingredients. Don't try to salvage scraps from vegetables that were already past their prime.

### Problem: I keep forgetting to refrigerate my scraps, and they sit out for hours.

**Diagnosis:** You need a better workflow.

**Fix:** Set a timer. Every 30 minutes during active cooking, move scraps to the fridge. Or, keep a small cooler with ice packs on the counter and store scraps there temporarily until you're done cooking.

**Prevention:** Build the habit. Treat scrap storage with the same seriousness you'd treat raw meat storage.

### Problem: My family thinks this is gross and won't participate.

**Diagnosis:** You need better framing (and maybe better-looking containers).

**Fix:** Don't call it "Drain Salad" around squeamish people. Call it "prep for stock" or "mise for tomorrow's frittata." Invest in attractive, clearly labeled containers—people are more likely to use a system that looks intentional and professional.

**Prevention:** Cook them something delicious made from scraps. Once they taste how good it is, they'll get on board.

### Problem: I don't generate enough scraps to make a full dish.

**Diagnosis:** That's fine! Not every household cooks enough to generate scrap-based meals daily.

**Fix:** Freeze your scraps in labeled bags until you have enough. A gallon bag of frozen vegetable trim makes excellent stock. A quart of bread ends becomes a pan of savory bread pudding.

**Prevention:** Adjust your expectations. Drain Salad doesn't have to be an everyday thing. Even once a week, you're diverting pounds of food from the waste stream.

## The Separation Doctrine: Raw Animal Products vs. Everything Else

This is critical, so it gets its own section.

**Never, ever mix scraps from raw animal products (meat, poultry, seafood) with vegetable scraps.**

Even if you're planning to cook everything later, cross-contamination during storage is a real risk. Bacteria from raw chicken can spread to your vegetable scraps, and unless you cook those vegetables to at least 165°F (the temperature required to kill *Salmonella*), you could make yourself or someone else very sick.

**The rule:** If you're breaking down a chicken, making fish stock, or trimming a roast, those scraps go into a separate container, labeled "ANIMAL—COOK IMMEDIATELY" or similar. Process them into stock or a cooked dish within a few hours, or freeze them raw in a clearly labeled bag.

Do not let raw animal scraps sit in the fridge for 48 hours like you might with vegetable scraps. The bacterial load is too high.

**Cross-contamination checklist:**
- Use separate cutting boards: one for produce, one for raw animal products. (Pro tip: color-code them—green for produce, red for meat.)
- Wash your hands thoroughly (20 seconds with soap) after handling raw animal products, before touching anything else.
- If your scrap bin accidentally gets contaminated (e.g., a drop of raw chicken juice), wash it immediately with hot, soapy water, then sanitize with bleach solution or in the dishwasher.

## A Note on Mindset: This Is Not About Perfection

The Clean-Catch Method sounds fussy when you first read it. Labeled containers! Timers! Sanitizing protocols! It can feel like a lot.

But here's the thing: once it becomes habit, it's no more complicated than washing your cutting board or putting leftovers in the fridge. It's just kitchen hygiene, extended logically to include scraps.

January 2022. I'm six weeks into using the Clean-Catch Method. I've set up Configuration 1—the cheap version, the mixing bowl and strainer on my counter. I'm feeling very proud of myself for being so organized and intentional.

Then I leave vegetable scraps sitting out for three hours while I watch a movie. Completely forget about them. When I finally remember and go to refrigerate them, they smell… off. Not terrible, but not right. I know I should throw them out. But I've already mentally committed to making soup with them tomorrow.

I make the soup anyway.

The soup tastes weird. Not unsafe—I cooked it to boiling—but flat, slightly bitter, vaguely unpleasant. I eat it because I'm stubborn and broke, but I'm mad at myself the whole time. That's when I started setting a timer. Not because I'm naturally organized, but because I learned that saving scraps poorly is worse than not saving them at all.

You will forget to refrigerate scraps sometimes. You will mix incompatible items. You will let something sit too long and have to throw it out. That's fine. The goal is not zero waste (an impossible standard). The goal is *less* waste, and more intention.

Every scrap you save is a small victory. Every meal you make from offcuts is a reminder that you're participating in a lineage of cooks—medieval scullery maids, Italian nonnas, professional chefs—who understood that food is too precious to squander.

You're not trying to be perfect. You're just trying to see your kitchen clearly, and act accordingly.

**Photography note:** *This chapter needs diagrams and process shots. Include: (1) an overhead view of each configuration setup, with components labeled; (2) step-by-step photos of scraps being transferred from cutting board to container to fridge; (3) a visual guide to "Yes/No" items—what goes in the scrap bin and what doesn't; (4) a shot of properly labeled containers with date codes; (5) before-and-after shots of sanitizing (dirty sink vs. clean, sanitized sink). The tone should be instructional, clean, and calm—like an IKEA assembly guide, but for food safety.*
