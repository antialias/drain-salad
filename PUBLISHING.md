# 2. Rebuild
npm run publish:all
# 3. Re-upload to platforms
```

### KDP Updates
- "Edit" â†’ Upload new interior PDF
- Publish revision
- Live in 24-72 hours
- Existing buyers don't get update (unless you contact KDP support)

### Gumroad/Itch.io Updates
- Just replace the file
- Existing customers can re-download automatically

## Advanced: Automation with auto-kdp

Once you've done one manual upload and understand KDP:

```bash
# Install auto-kdp (optional)
git clone https://github.com/ekr0/auto-kdp.git tools/auto-kdp
cd tools/auto-kdp && npm install

# Generate config
# (Script coming soon)

# Auto-upload
# npm run publish:kdp-auto
```

## Troubleshooting

### "Typst not found"
```bash
# macOS
brew install typst

# Linux
cargo install typst

# Or download from: https://github.com/typst/typst/releases
```

### "Pandoc not found" (for EPUB)
```bash
brew install pandoc
```

### "PDF too large" (>650MB)
KDP has 650MB limit. Solutions:
1. Reduce image quality in `typst/template.typ`
2. Use fewer images
3. Convert images to JPEG instead of PNG
4. Use `npm run publish:optimized` (requires Ghostscript)

### "Bleed not showing"
- Make sure you uploaded `drain-salad-print.pdf` (not regular)
- Select "Yes" for bleed in KDP
- Check trim size is 6x9

### "EPUB has broken images"
- Ensure image paths in markdown are relative
- Check images exist in `manuscript/images/`
- Test with Calibre: `calibre build/drain-salad.epub`

## Support

If you run into issues:
1. Check this guide
2. Check platform help docs (KDP, Gumroad have great support)
3. Re-run builds with fresh `npm run publish:all`

## File Reference

After running `npm run publish:all`, you'll have:

```
build/
â”œâ”€â”€ drain-salad-typst.pdf      # Regular PDF (for viewing)
â”œâ”€â”€ drain-salad-print.pdf      # Print-ready with bleed (â†’ KDP paperback)

```

Upload the right file to the right place!

## Next Steps

1. **Fill in `book-metadata.json`** with your actual author info
2. **Run `npm run publish:all`** to build all formats
3. **Test the files** - open them, check quality
4. **Create KDP account** and do first manual upload
