# Author Visual Reference Sheet
## For Consistent AI-Generated Photography

### Physical Description

**Age:** Late 20s to early 30s
**Gender:** Male
**Ethnicity:** Italian-American (Mediterranean features)
**Build:** Average/slim build (former restaurant worker physique)
**Height reference:** 5'9"-5'11"

### Facial Features

**Face shape:** Oval to rectangular, defined jawline
**Eyes:** Dark brown, slightly tired-looking (worked long restaurant hours)
**Eyebrows:** Dark, naturally full
**Nose:** Medium, slightly Roman/aquiline (Italian heritage)
**Mouth:** Medium lips, often has slight smirk or focused expression
**Facial hair:** 2-3 day stubble or short beard, dark brown
**Hair:** Dark brown to black, slightly wavy/curly, medium length (between ears and shoulders), often looks slightly unkempt or pulled back in a low bun
**Skin tone:** Olive/Mediterranean, tanned from working in kitchens
**Notable features:** Slightly weary but intelligent eyes, laugh lines forming, hands show signs of kitchen work (minor burns/scars)

### Style/Clothing

**Kitchen scenes:**
- Plain t-shirt (black, gray, white) or henley
- Sometimes worn apron (canvas, dark colors, stained from use)
- No chef whites (this is a garde-manger/home cook, not fine dining)

**Casual scenes:**
- Flannel shirts (muted colors)
- Well-worn jeans
- Simple button-downs rolled to elbows
- Looks like someone who spent their clothing budget on good knives

**Overall vibe:** Competent but not precious. Looks like a cook who's done the work, not a TV chef. More Bourdain than Fieri.

### Settings/Contexts Where Author Appears

1. **Kitchen counter prep station** - mid-prep, hands working
2. **Holding a jar of ferments** - checking fermentation progress
3. **Farmers market or grocery** - shopping for produce
4. **Small apartment kitchen** - cramped but organized
5. **Standing at stove** - saut√©ing or stirring
6. **Close-up of hands** - knife work, massaging kale, shaping bread

### Photography Style for Author Photos

- Natural light preferred
- Slightly documentary/reportage feel (not staged)
- Shallow depth of field (subject in focus, background slightly blurred)
- Colors: warm tones, slightly desaturated (film photography feel)
- Never overly polished or styled
- Should feel like behind-the-scenes restaurant photography

### Key Prompt Elements for Consistency

**Core descriptor to use in every author photo:**
"Italian-American man in his late 20s, dark brown wavy medium-length hair often pulled back, 2-day stubble, olive skin, dark brown eyes, wearing [context-appropriate clothing], in [setting], documentary photography style, natural lighting, warm tones, film photography aesthetic, shallow depth of field"

**Reference concept:** Think early Anthony Bourdain meets indie restaurant cook meets David Chang in his Momofuku days - competent, slightly weary, no-bullshit attitude visible in posture and expression.

## Image Generation Workflow

1. Generate 1-2 "reference" author photos first
2. Use those as visual reference for subsequent generations (if tool supports it)
3. Maintain consistent prompt structure across all author photos
4. For Midjourney: use `--cref` with URL of first generated image
5. For DALL-E: include "same person as [previous description]" in prompts
6. For Stable Diffusion: use LoRA/DreamBooth training on initial images
